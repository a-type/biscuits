     * Dirty trick ahead - literally!
     * This function forces an invalidation of the rasterized layer for
     * this draggable (hence the 'dirty' joke, get it?). It does that by toggling
     * off will-change: transform for one frame, then toggling it back on again. This
     * effectively 'flattens' the layer which is created for this specific item back into
     * the canvas (will-change: initial), then recreates the layer again (will-change: transform).
     * Doing so re-rasterizes the layer at the current scale level, so that even 2x images and text
     * are re-sharpened.
     *
     * We need this trick because just applying `will-change: transform` all the time doesn't seem
     * to properly re-rasterize when the scale changes, leading to blurriness. By manually invalidating
     * the layer (read: not just invalidating but trashing and re-creating - this could be less than
     * desirable) we can choose to re-sharpen the contents after the user has changed the zoom of the
     * viewport, which is the most logical and only necessary time to do it.
     *
     * TODO: if we need to optimize this even further, we could avoid re-rasterizing widgets which are
     * currently offscreen!
