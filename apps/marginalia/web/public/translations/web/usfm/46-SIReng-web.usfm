\ip \bk The Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach\bk*, also called \bk Ecclesiasticus\bk*, is recognized as Deuterocanonical Scripture by the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Russian Orthodox Churches. 
\is1 The Prologue of the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach. 
\ip WHEREAS many and great things have been delivered to us by the law and the prophets, and by the others that have followed in their steps, for which we must give Israel the praise for instruction and wisdom; and since not only the readers need to become skillful themselves, but also those who love learning must be able to profit those who are outside, both by speaking and writing; my grandfather Jesus, having much given himself to the reading of the law, and the prophets, and the other books of our fathers, and having gained great familiarity with them, was also drawn on himself to write somewhat pertaining to instruction and wisdom, in order that those who love learning, and are devoted to these things, might make progress much more by living according to the law. You are entreated therefore to read with favor and attention, and to pardon us, if in any parts of what we have labored to interpret, we may seem to fail in some of the phrases. For things originally spoken in Hebrew don’t have the same force in them when they are translated into another language. Not only these, but the law itself, and the prophecies, and the rest of the books, have no small difference, when they are spoken in their original language. For having come into Egypt in the thirty-eighth year of Energetes the king, and having continued there some time, I found a copy giving no small instruction. I thought it therefore most necessary for me to apply some diligence and travail to translate this book, applying indeed much watchfulness and skill in that space of time to bring the book to an end and publish for them also, who in the land of their travels are desiring to learn, preparing their character in advance, so as to live according to the law.

\v 1 All wisdom comes from the Lord, 
\q2 and is with him forever. 
\q1
\v 2 Who can count the sand of the seas, 
\q2 the drops of rain, 
\q2 and the days of eternity? 
\q1
\v 3 Who will search out the height of the sky, 
\q2 the breadth of the earth, the deep, 
\q2 and wisdom? 
\q1
\v 4 Wisdom has been created before all things, 
\q2 and the understanding of prudence from everlasting. 
\v 5  \f + \fr 1:5  \ft Verse 5 is omitted by the best authorities: \fqa The source of wisdom is God’s word in the highest heaven, and her ways are the eternal commandments.\f* 
\q1
\v 6 To whom has the root of wisdom been revealed? 
\q2 Who has known her shrewd counsels? 
\v 7  \f + \fr 1:7  \ft Verse 7 is omitted by the best authorities: \fqa To whom was the knowledge of wisdom manifested? Who has understood her abundant experience?\f* 
\q1
\v 8 There is one wise, greatly to be feared, 
\q2 sitting upon his throne: the Lord. 
\q1
\v 9 He created her. 
\q2 He saw and measured her. 
\q2 He poured her out upon all his works. 
\q1
\v 10 She is with all flesh according to his gift. 
\q2 He gave her freely to those who love him. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 The fear of the Lord is glory, exultation, 
\q2 gladness, and a crown of rejoicing. 
\q1
\v 12 The fear of the Lord will delight the heart, 
\q2 and will give gladness, joy, and length of days. 
\q1
\v 13 Whoever fears the Lord, it will go well with him at the last. 
\q2 He will be blessed in the day of his death. 
\b
\q1
\v 14 To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. 
\q2 It was created together with the faithful in the womb. 
\q1
\v 15 She\f + \fr 1:15  \ft Gr. \fqa nested. \f* laid an eternal foundation with men. 
\q2 She will be trusted among their offspring. 
\q1
\v 16 To fear the Lord is the fullness of wisdom. 
\q2 She inebriates men with her fruits. 
\q1
\v 17 She will fill all her house with desirable things, 
\q2 and her storehouses with her produce. 
\q1
\v 18 The fear of the Lord is the crown of wisdom, 
\q2 making peace and\f + \fr 1:18  \ft Gr. \fqa health of cure. \f* perfect health to flourish.\f + \fr 1:18  \ft The remainder of this verse is omitted by the best authorities: \fqa Both are gifts of God for peace; glory opens out for those who love him. He saw her and took her measure.\f* 
\q1
\v 19 He both saw and measured her. 
\q2 He rained down skill and knowledge of understanding, 
\q2 and exalted the honor of those who hold her fast. 
\q1
\v 20 To fear the Lord is the root of wisdom. 
\q2 Her branches are length of days. 
\v 21  \f + \fr 1:21  \ft Verse 21 is omitted by the best authorities: \fqa The fear of the Lord drives away sins. Where it resides, it will turn away all anger. \f* 
\b
\q1
\v 22 Unjust wrath can never be justified, 
\q2 for his wrath tips the scale to his downfall. 
\q1
\v 23 A man that is patient will resist for a season, 
\q2 and afterward gladness will spring up to him. 
\q1
\v 24 He will hide his words until the right moment, 
\q2 and the lips of many will tell of his understanding. 
\b
\q1
\v 25 A wise saying is in the treasures of wisdom; 
\q2 but godliness is an abomination to a sinner. 
\q1
\v 26 If you desire wisdom, keep the commandments 
\q2 and the Lord will give her to you freely; 
\q1
\v 27 for the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction. 
\q2 Faith and humility are his good pleasure. 
\q1
\v 28 Don’t disobey the fear of the Lord. 
\q2 Don’t come to him with a double heart. 
\q1
\v 29 Don’t be a hypocrite in men’s sight. 
\q2 Keep watch over your lips. 
\q1
\v 30 Don’t exalt yourself, 
\q2 lest you fall and bring dishonor upon your soul. 
\q1 The Lord will reveal your secrets 
\q2 and will cast you down in the midst of the congregation, 
\q2 because you didn’t come to the fear of the Lord 
\q2 and your heart was full of deceit. 
\b
\c  2  
\q1
\v 1 My son, if you come to serve the Lord, 
\q2 prepare your soul for temptation. 
\q1
\v 2 Set your heart aright, constantly endure, 
\q2 and don’t make haste in time of calamity. 
\q1
\v 3 Cling to him, and don’t depart, 
\q2 that you may be increased at your latter end. 
\q1
\v 4 Accept whatever is brought upon you, 
\q2 and be patient when you suffer humiliation. 
\q1
\v 5 For gold is tried in the fire, 
\q2 and acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation. 
\q1
\v 6 Put your trust in him, and he will help you. 
\q2 Make your ways straight, and set your hope on him. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 All you who fear the Lord, wait for his mercy. 
\q2 Don’t turn aside, lest you fall. 
\q1
\v 8 All you who fear the Lord, put your trust in him, 
\q2 and your reward will not fail. 
\q1
\v 9 All you who fear the Lord, hope for good things, 
\q2 and for eternal gladness and mercy. 
\q1
\v 10 Look at the generations of old, and see: 
\q2 Who ever put his trust in the Lord, and was ashamed? 
\q2 Or who remained in his fear, and was forsaken? 
\q2 Or who called upon him, and he neglected him? 
\q1
\v 11 For the Lord is full of compassion and mercy. 
\q2 He forgives sins and saves in time of affliction. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 Woe to fearful hearts, to faint hands, 
\q2 and to the sinner who goes two ways! 
\q1
\v 13 Woe to the faint heart! For it doesn’t believe. 
\q2 Therefore it won’t be defended. 
\q1
\v 14 Woe to you who have lost your patience! 
\q2 And what will you all do when the Lord visits you? 
\b
\q1
\v 15 Those who fear the Lord will not disobey his words. 
\q2 Those who love him will keep his ways. 
\q1
\v 16 Those who fear the Lord will seek his good pleasure. 
\q2 Those who love him will be filled with the law. 
\q1
\v 17 Those who fear the Lord will prepare their hearts, 
\q2 and will humble their souls in his sight. 
\q1
\v 18 We will fall into the hands of the Lord, 
\q2 and not into the hands of men; 
\q1 for as his majesty is, 
\q2 so also is his mercy. 
\b
\c  3  
\q1
\v 1 Hear me, your father, O my children, 
\q2 and do what you hear, that you all may be safe. 
\q1
\v 2 For the Lord honors the father over the children, 
\q2 and has confirmed the judgment of the mother over her sons. 
\q1
\v 3 He who honors his father will make atonement for sins. 
\q2
\v 4 He who gives glory to his mother is as one who lays up treasure. 
\q1
\v 5 Whoever honors his father will have joy in his own children. 
\q2 He will be heard in the day of his prayer. 
\q1
\v 6 He who gives glory to his father will have length of days. 
\q2 He who listens to the Lord will bring rest to his mother, 
\q1
\v 7  \f + \fr 3:7  \ft Some manuscripts add \fqa those who fear the Lord honor their father,\f* and will serve under his parents, as to masters. 
\q1
\v 8 Honor your father in deed and word, 
\q2 that a blessing may come upon you from him. 
\q1
\v 9 For the blessing of the father establishes the houses of children, 
\q2 but the curse of the mother roots out the foundations. 
\b
\q1
\v 10 Don’t glorify yourself in the dishonor of your father, 
\q2 for your father’s dishonor is no glory to you. 
\q1
\v 11 For the glory of a man is from the honor of his father, 
\q2 and a mother in dishonor is a reproach to her children. 
\q1
\v 12 My son, help your father in his old age, 
\q2 and don’t grieve him as long as he lives. 
\q1
\v 13 If he fails in understanding, have patience with him. 
\q2 Don’t dishonor him in your full strength. 
\q1
\v 14 For the kindness to your father will not be forgotten. 
\q2 Instead of sins it will be added to build you up. 
\q1
\v 15 In the day of your affliction it will be remembered for you, 
\q2 as fair weather upon ice, 
\q2 so your sins will also melt away. 
\q1
\v 16 He who forsakes his father is as a blasphemer. 
\q2 He who provokes his mother is cursed by the Lord. 
\b
\q1
\v 17 My son, go on with your business in humility; 
\q2 so you will be loved by an acceptable man. 
\q1
\v 18 The greater you are, humble yourself the more, 
\q2 and you will find favor before the Lord. 
\v 19  \f + \fr 3:19  \ft Some manuscripts add \fqa Many are lofty and renowned, but he reveals his secrets to the humble.\f* 
\q1
\v 20 For the power of the Lord is great, 
\q2 and he is glorified by those who are lowly. 
\q1
\v 21 Don’t seek things that are too hard for you, 
\q2 and don’t search out things that are above your strength. 
\q1
\v 22 Think about the things that have been commanded you, 
\q2 for you have no need of the things that are secret. 
\q1
\v 23 Don’t be overly busy in tasks that are beyond you, 
\q2 for more things are shown to you than men can understand. 
\q1
\v 24 For the conceit of many has led them astray. 
\q2 Evil opinion has caused their judgment to slip. 
\q1
\v 25  \f + \fr 3:25  \ft Some manuscripts omit verse 25.\f*There is no light without eyes. 
\q2 There is no wisdom without knowledge. 
\b
\q1
\v 26 A stubborn heart will do badly at the end. 
\q2 He who loves danger will perish in it. 
\q1
\v 27 A stubborn heart will be burdened with troubles. 
\q2 The sinner will heap sin upon sins. 
\q1
\v 28 The calamity of the proud has no healing, 
\q2 for a weed of wickedness has taken root in him. 
\q1
\v 29 The heart of the prudent will understand a proverb. 
\q2 A wise man desires the ear of a listener. 
\b
\q1
\v 30 Water will quench a flaming fire; 
\q2 almsgiving will make atonement for sins. 
\q1
\v 31 He who repays good turns is mindful of that which comes afterward. 
\q2 In the time of his falling he will find a support. 
\b
\c  4  
\q1
\v 1 My son, don’t deprive the poor of his living. 
\q2 Don’t make the needy eyes wait long. 
\q1
\v 2 Don’t make a hungry soul sorrowful, 
\q2 or provoke a man in his distress. 
\q1
\v 3 Don’t add more trouble to a heart that is provoked. 
\q2 Don’t put off giving to him who is in need. 
\q1
\v 4 Don’t reject a suppliant in his affliction. 
\q2 Don’t turn your face away from a poor man. 
\q1
\v 5 Don’t turn your eye away from one who asks. 
\q2 Give no occasion to a man to curse you. 
\q1
\v 6 For if he curses you in the bitterness of his soul, 
\q2 he who made him will hear his supplication. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 Endear yourself to the assembly. 
\q2 Bow your head to a great man. 
\q1
\v 8 Incline your ear to a poor man. 
\q2 Answer him with peaceful words in humility. 
\q1
\v 9 Deliver him who is wronged from the hand of him who wrongs him; 
\q2 Don’t be hesitant in giving judgment. 
\q1
\v 10 Be as a father to the fatherless, 
\q2 and like a husband to their mother. 
\q1 So you will be as a son of the Most High, 
\q2 and he will love you more than your mother does. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 Wisdom exalts her sons, 
\q2 and takes hold of those who seek her. 
\q1
\v 12 He who loves her loves life. 
\q2 Those who seek her early will be filled with gladness. 
\q1
\v 13 He who holds her fast will inherit glory. 
\q2 Where\f + \fr 4:13  \ft Or, \fqa she \f* he enters, the Lord will bless. 
\q1
\v 14 Those who serve her minister to the Holy One. 
\q2 The Lord loves those who love her. 
\q1
\v 15 He who listens to her will judge the nations. 
\q2 He who heeds her will dwell securely. 
\q1
\v 16 If he trusts her, he will inherit her, 
\q2 and his generations will possess her. 
\q1
\v 17 For at the first she will walk with him in crooked ways, 
\q2 and will bring fear and dread upon him, 
\q2 and torment him with her discipline, 
\q2 until she may trust his soul, and try him by her judgments. 
\q1
\v 18 Then she will return him again to the straight way, 
\q2 and will gladden him, and reveal to him her secrets. 
\q1
\v 19 If he goes astray, she will forsake him, 
\q2 and hand him over to his fall. 
\b
\q1
\v 20 Watch for the opportunity, and beware of evil. 
\q2 Don’t be ashamed of your soul. 
\q1
\v 21 For there is a shame that brings sin, 
\q2 and there is a shame that is glory and grace. 
\q1
\v 22 Don’t show partiality, discrediting your soul. 
\q2 Don’t revere any man to your falling. 
\q1
\v 23 Don’t refrain from speaking when it is for safety. 
\q2 \f + \fr 4:23  \ft Some manuscripts omit this line. \f*Don’t hide your wisdom for the sake of seeming fair. 
\q1
\v 24 For wisdom will be known by speech, 
\q2 and instruction by the word of the tongue. 
\q1
\v 25 Don’t speak against the truth 
\q2 and be shamed for your ignorance. 
\q1
\v 26 Don’t be ashamed to confess your sins. 
\q2 Don’t fight the river’s current. 
\q1
\v 27 Don’t lay yourself down for a fool to tread upon. 
\q2 Don’t be partial to one who is mighty. 
\q1
\v 28 Strive for the truth to death, 
\q2 and the Lord God will fight for you. 
\b
\q1
\v 29 Don’t be hasty with your tongue, 
\q2 or slack and negligent in your deeds. 
\q1
\v 30 Don’t be like a lion in your house, 
\q2 or suspicious of your servants. 
\q1
\v 31 Don’t let your hand be stretched out to receive, 
\q2 and closed when you should repay. 
\c 5  
\q1
\v 1 Don’t set your heart upon your goods. 
\q2 Don’t say, “They are sufficient for me.” 
\q1
\v 2 Don’t follow your own mind and your strength 
\q2 to walk in the desires of your heart. 
\q1
\v 3 Don’t say, “Who will have dominion over me?” 
\q2 for the Lord will surely take vengeance on you. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Don’t say, “I sinned, and what happened to me?” 
\q2 for the Lord is patient. 
\q1
\v 5 Don’t be so confident of atonement 
\q2 that you add sin upon sins. 
\q1
\v 6 Don’t say, “His compassion is great. 
\q2 He will be pacified for the multitude of my sins,” 
\q2 for mercy and wrath are with him, 
\q2 and his indignation will rest on sinners. 
\q1
\v 7 Don’t wait to turn to the Lord. 
\q2 Don’t put off from day to day; 
\q2 for suddenly the wrath of the Lord will come on you, 
\q2 and you will perish in the time of vengeance. 
\b
\q1
\v 8 Don’t set your heart upon unrighteous gains, 
\q2 for you will profit nothing in the day of calamity. 
\q1
\v 9 Don’t winnow with every wind. 
\q2 Don’t walk in every path. 
\q2 This is what the sinner who has a double tongue does. 
\q1
\v 10 Be steadfast in your understanding. 
\q2 Let your speech be consistent. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 Be swift to hear 
\q2 and answer with patience. 
\q1
\v 12 If you have understanding, answer your neighbor; 
\q2 but if not, put your hand over your mouth. 
\q1
\v 13 Glory and dishonor is in talk. 
\q2 A man’s tongue may be his downfall. 
\q1
\v 14 Don’t be called a whisperer. 
\q2 Don’t lie in wait with your tongue; 
\q2 for shame is on the thief, 
\q2 and an evil condemnation is on him who has a double tongue. 
\q1
\v 15 Don’t be ignorant in a great or small matter. 
\c 6  
\q1
\v 1 Don’t become an enemy instead of a friend; 
\q2 for an evil name will inherit shame and reproach. 
\q2 So it is with the sinner who has a double tongue. 
\b
\q1
\v 2 Don’t exalt yourself in the counsel of your soul, 
\q2 that your soul not be torn in pieces like a bull. 
\q1
\v 3 You will eat up your leaves, destroy your fruit, 
\q2 and leave yourself like a dry tree. 
\q1
\v 4 A wicked soul will destroy him who has it, 
\q2 and will make him a laughing stock to his enemies. 
\b
\q1
\v 5 Sweet words will multiply a man’s friends. 
\q2 A gracious tongue will multiply courtesies. 
\q1
\v 6 Let those that are at peace with you be many, 
\q2 but your advisers one of a thousand. 
\q1
\v 7 If you want to gain a friend, get him in a time of testing, 
\q2 and don’t be in a hurry to trust him. 
\q1
\v 8 For there is a friend just for an occasion. 
\q2 He won’t continue in the day of your affliction. 
\q1
\v 9 And there is a friend who turns into an enemy. 
\q2 He will discover strife to your reproach. 
\q1
\v 10 And there is a friend who is a companion at the table, 
\q2 but he won’t continue in the day of your affliction. 
\q1
\v 11 In your prosperity he will be as yourself, 
\q2 and will be bold over your servants. 
\q1
\v 12 If you are brought low, he will be against you, 
\q2 and will hide himself from your face. 
\q1
\v 13 Separate yourself from your enemies, 
\q2 and beware of your friends. 
\b
\q1
\v 14 A faithful friend is a strong defense. 
\q2 He who has found him has found a treasure. 
\q1
\v 15 There is nothing that can be taken in exchange for a faithful friend. 
\q2 His excellency is beyond price. 
\q1
\v 16 A faithful friend is a life-saving medicine. 
\q2 Those who fear the Lord will find him. 
\q1
\v 17 He who fears the Lord directs his friendship properly; 
\q2 for as he is, so is his neighbor also. 
\b
\q1
\v 18 My son, gather instruction from your youth up. 
\q2 Even when you have gray hair you will find wisdom. 
\q1
\v 19 Come to her as one who plows and sows 
\q2 and wait for her good fruit; 
\q1 for your toil will be little in her cultivation, 
\q2 and you will soon eat of her fruit. 
\q1
\v 20 How exceedingly harsh she is to the unlearned! 
\q2 He who is without understanding will not remain in her. 
\q1
\v 21 She will rest upon him as a mighty stone of trial. 
\q2 He won’t hesitate to cast her from him. 
\q1
\v 22 For wisdom is according to her name. 
\q1 She isn’t manifest to many. 
\b
\q1
\v 23 Give ear, my son, and accept my judgment. 
\q2 Don’t refuse my counsel. 
\q1
\v 24 Bring your feet into her fetters, 
\q2 and your neck into her chain. 
\q1
\v 25 Put your shoulder under her and bear her. 
\q2 Don’t be grieved with her bonds. 
\q1
\v 26 Come to her with all your soul. 
\q2 Keep her ways with your whole power. 
\q1
\v 27 Search and seek, and she will be made known to you. 
\q2 When you get hold of her, don’t let her go. 
\q1
\v 28 For at the last you will find her rest; 
\q2 and she will be turned for you into gladness. 
\q1
\v 29 Her fetters will be to you for a covering of strength, 
\q2 and her chains for a robe of glory. 
\q1
\v 30 For there is a golden ornament upon her, 
\q2 and her bands are \x + \xo 6:30  \xt Numbers 15:38\x* a purple cord. 
\q1
\v 31 You shall put her on as a robe of glory, 
\q2 and shall put her on as a crown of rejoicing. 
\b
\q1
\v 32 My son, if you are willing, you will be instructed. 
\q2 If you will yield your soul, you will be prudent. 
\q1
\v 33 If you love to hear, you will receive. 
\q2 If you incline your ear, you will be wise. 
\q1
\v 34 Stand in the multitude of the elders. 
\q2 Attach yourself to whomever is wise. 
\q1
\v 35 Be willing to listen to every godly discourse. 
\q2 Don’t let the proverbs of understanding escape you. 
\q1
\v 36 If you see a man of understanding, get to him early. 
\q2 Let your foot wear out the steps of his doors. 
\q1
\v 37 Let your mind dwell on the ordinances of the Lord 
\q2 and meditate continually on his commandments. 
\q1 He will establish your heart 
\q2 and your desire for wisdom will be given to you. 
\b
\c  7  
\q1
\v 1 Do no evil, 
\q2 so no evil will overtake you. 
\q1
\v 2 Depart from wrong, 
\q2 and it will turn away from you. 
\q1
\v 3 My son, don’t sow upon the furrows of unrighteousness, 
\q2 and you won’t reap them sevenfold. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Don’t seek preeminence from the Lord, 
\q2 nor the seat of honor from the king. 
\q1
\v 5 Don’t justify yourself in the presence of the Lord, 
\q2 and don’t display your wisdom before the king. 
\q1
\v 6 Don’t seek to be a judge, 
\q2 lest you not be able to take away iniquities, 
\q2 lest perhaps you fear the person of a mighty man, 
\q2 and lay a stumbling block in the way of your uprightness. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 Don’t sin against the multitude of the city. 
\q2 Don’t disgrace yourself in the crowd. 
\b
\q1
\v 8 Don’t commit a sin twice, 
\q2 for even in one you will not be unpunished. 
\q1
\v 9 Don’t say, “He will look upon the multitude of my gifts. 
\q2 When I make an offering to the Most High God, he will accept it.” 
\q1
\v 10 Don’t be faint-hearted in your prayer. 
\q2 Don’t neglect to give alms. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 Don’t laugh a man to scorn when he is in the bitterness of his soul, 
\q2 for there is one who humbles and exalts. 
\q1
\v 12  Don’t devise\f + \fr 7:12  \ft Gr. \fqa Don’t plow\f* a lie against your brother, 
\q2 or do the same to a friend. 
\q1
\v 13 Refuse to utter a lie,

\q2 He won’t enjoy his possessions. 
\q1
\v 6 There is none more evil than he who is grudging to himself. 
\q2 This is a punishment for his wickedness. 
\q1
\v 7 Even if he does good, he does it in forgetfulness. 
\q2 In the end, he reveals his wickedness. 
\q1
\v 8 A miser is evil. 
\q2 He turns away and disregards souls. 
\q1
\v 9 A covetous man’s eye is not satisfied with his portion. 
\q2 Wicked injustice dries up his soul. 
\q1
\v 10 A miser begrudges bread,

\q1
\v 11 My son, according to what you have, treat yourself well, 
\q2 and bring worthy offerings to the Lord. 
\q1
\v 12 Remember that death will not wait, 
\q2 and that the covenant of Hades hasn’t been shown to you. 
\q1
\v 13 Do good to your friends before you die. 
\q2 According to your ability, reach out and give to them. 
\q1
\v 14 Don’t deprive yourself of a good day. 
\q2 Don’t let your share of a desired good pass you by. 
\q1
\v 15 Won’t you leave your labors to another, 
\q2 and your toils be divided by lot? 
\q1
\v 16 Give, take, and treat yourself well, 
\q2 because there is no seeking of luxury in Hades. 
\q1
\v 17 All flesh grows old like a garment, 
\q2 for the covenant from the beginning is, “You must die!” 
\q1
\v 18 Like the leaves flourishing on a thick tree, 
\q2 some it sheds, and some grow, 
\q1 so also are the generations of flesh and blood: 
\q2 one comes to an end and another is born.

\v 19 Every work rots and falls away,

\v 20 Blessed is the man who meditates on wisdom, 
\q2 and who reasons by his understanding. 
\q1
\v 21 He who considers her ways in his heart 
\q2 will also have knowledge of her secrets. 
\q1
\v 22 Go after her like a hunter, 
\q2 and lie in wait in her paths. 
\q1
\v 23 He who peers in at her windows 
\q2 will also listen at her doors. 
\q1
\v 24 He who lodges close to her house 
\q2 will also fasten a nail in her walls. 
\q1
\v 25 He will pitch his tent near at hand to her, 
\q2 and will lodge in a lodging where good things are. 
\q1
\v 26 He will set his children under her shelter, 
\q2 and will rest under her branches. 
\q1
\v 27 By her he will be covered from heat, 
\q2 and will lodge in her glory. 
\c 15  
\q1
\v 1 He who fears the Lord will do this. 
\q2 He who has possession of the law will obtain her. 
\q1
\v 2 She will meet him like a mother, 
\q2 and receive him like a wife married in her virginity. 
\q1
\v 3 She will feed him with bread of understanding 
\q2 and give him water of wisdom to drink. 
\q1
\v 4 He will be stayed upon her, and will not be moved. 
\q2 He will rely upon her, and will not be confounded. 
\q1
\v 5 She will exalt him above his neighbors. 
\q2 She will open his mouth in the midst of the congregation. 
\q1
\v 6 He will inherit joy, a crown of gladness, 
\q2 and an everlasting name. 
\q1
\v 7 Foolish men will not obtain her. 
\q2 Sinners will not see her. 
\q1
\v 8 She is far from pride. 
\q2 Liars will not remember her. 
\q1
\v 9 Praise is not attractive in the mouth of a sinner; 
\q2 for it was not sent to him from the Lord. 
\q1
\v 10 For praise will be spoken in wisdom; 
\q2 The Lord will prosper it. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 Don’t say, “It is through the Lord that I fell away;” 
\q2 for you shall not do the things that he hates. 
\q1
\v 12 Don’t say, “It is he that caused me to err;” 
\q2 for he has no need of a sinful man. 
\q1
\v 13 The Lord hates every abomination; 
\q2 and those who fear him don’t love them. 
\q1
\v 14 He himself made man from the beginning 
\q2 and left him in the hand of his own counsel. 
\q1
\v 15 If you choose, you can keep the commandments. 
\q2 To be faithful is a matter of your choice. 
\q1
\v 16 He has set fire and water before you. 
\q2 You will stretch forth your hand to whichever you desire. 
\q1
\v 17 Before man is life and death. 
\q2 Whichever he likes, it will be given to him. 
\q1
\v 18 For the wisdom of the Lord is great. 
\q2 He is mighty in power, and sees all things. 
\q1
\v 19 His eyes are upon those who fear him. 
\q2 He knows every act of man. 
\q1
\v 20 He has not commanded any man to be ungodly. 
\q2 He has not given any man license to sin. 
\b
\c  16  
\q1
\v 1 Don’t desire a multitude of unprofitable children,

\q1
\v 2 If they multiply, don’t delight in them 
\q2 unless the fear of the Lord is in them. 
\q1
\v 3 Don’t trust in their life. 
\q2 Don’t rely on their numbers; 
\q2 for one can be better than a thousand, 
\q2 and to die childless than to have ungodly children. 
\q1
\v 4 For from one who has understanding, a city will be populated, 
\q2 but a race of wicked men will be made desolate. 
\q1
\v 5 I have seen many such things with my eyes. 
\q2 My ear has heard mightier things than these. 
\b
\q1
\v 6 In a congregation of sinners, a fire will be kindled. 
\q2 In a disobedient nation, wrath is kindled. 
\q1
\v 7 He was not pacified toward the giants of old time, 
\q2 who revolted in their strength. 
\q1
\v 8 He didn’t spare Lot’s neighbors, 
\q2 whom he abhorred for their pride. 
\q1
\v 9 He didn’t pity the people of perdition 
\q2 who were taken away in their sins, 
\q2
\v 10 or in like manner, the six hundred thousand footmen 
\q2 who were gathered together in the hardness of their hearts. 
\q1
\v 11 Even if there is one stiff-necked person, 
\q2 it is a marvel if he will be unpunished; 
\q2 for mercy and wrath are both with him who is mighty to forgive, 
\q2 and he pours out wrath. 
\q1
\v 12 As his mercy is great, so is his correction also. 
\q2 He judges a man according to his works. 
\q1
\v 13 The sinner will not escape with plunder. 
\q2 The perseverance of the godly will not be frustrated. 
\q1
\v 14 He will make room for every work of mercy. 
\q2 Each man will receive according to his works.

\q1
\v 19 The mountains and the foundations of the earth together

\q1
\v 26 In the judgment of the Lord are his works from the beginning. 
\q2 From the making of them he determined their boundaries. 
\q1
\v 27 He arranged his works for all time,

\q1 They aren’t hungry or weary,

\v 13 Their eyes saw the majesty of his glory.

\v 13 The mercy of a man is on his neighbor;

\q2 reproving, chastening, teaching, 
\q2 and bringing back, as a shepherd does his flock.

\v 14 He has mercy on those who accept chastening,

\v 15 My son, don’t add reproach to your good deeds,

\v 2 As a nail will stick fast between the joinings of stones, 
\q2 so sin will thrust itself in between buying and selling. 
\q1
\v 3 Unless a person holds on diligently to the fear of the Lord, 
\q2 his house will be overthrown quickly. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 In the shaking of a sieve, the refuse remains, 
\q2 so does the filth of man in his thoughts. 
\q1
\v 5 The furnace tests the potter’s vessels; 
\q2 so the test of a person is in his thoughts. 
\q1
\v 6 The fruit of a tree discloses its cultivation, 
\q2 so is the utterance of the thought of a person’s heart. 
\q1
\v 7 Praise no man before you hear his thoughts, 
\q2 for this is how people are tested. 
\b
\q1
\v 8 If you follow righteousness, you will obtain it, 
\q1 and put it on like a long robe of glory. 
\q1
\v 9 Birds will return to their own kind, 
\q2 so truth will return to those who practice it. 
\q1
\v 10 The lion lies in wait for prey. 
\q2 So does sin for those who do evil. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 The discourse of a godly man is always wise, 
\q2 but the fool changes like the moon. 
\q1
\v 12 Limit your time among people void of understanding, 
\q2 but persevere among the thoughtful. 
\q1
\v 13 The talk of fools is offensive. 
\q2 Their laughter is wantonly sinful. 
\q1
\v 14 Their talk with much swearing makes hair stand upright. 
\q2 Their strife makes others plug their ears. 
\q1
\v 15 The strife of the proud leads to bloodshed. 
\q2 Their abuse of each other is a grievous thing to hear. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 He who reveals secrets destroys trust, 
\q2 and will not find a close friend. 
\q1
\v 17 Love a friend, and keep faith with him; 
\q2 but if you reveal his secrets, 
\q2 you shall not follow him; 
\q1
\v 18 for as a man has destroyed his enemy, 
\q2 so you have destroyed the friendship of your neighbor. 
\q1
\v 19 As a bird which you have released out of your hand, 
\q2 so you have let your neighbor go, and you will not catch him again. 
\q1
\v 20 Don’t pursue him, for he has gone far away, 
\q2 and has escaped like a gazelle out of the snare. 
\q1
\v 21 For a wound may be bound up, and after abuse there may be reconciliation; 
\q2 but he who reveals secrets is without hope. 
\b
\q1
\v 22 One who winks the eye contrives evil things; 
\q2 and those who know him will keep their distance. 
\q1
\v 23 When you are present, he will speak sweetly, 
\q2 and will admire your words; 
\q2 but afterward he will twist his speech 
\q2 and set a trap in your words. 
\q1
\v 24 I have hated many things, but nothing like him. 
\q2 The Lord will hate him. 
\b
\q1
\v 25 One who casts a stone straight up casts it on his own head. 
\q2 A deceitful blow opens wounds. 
\q1
\v 26 He who digs a pit will fall into it. 
\q2 He who sets a snare will be caught in it. 
\q1
\v 27 He who does evil things, they will roll back upon him, 
\q2 and he will not know where they came from. 
\q1
\v 28 Mockery and reproach are from the arrogant. 
\q2 Vengeance lies in wait for them like a lion. 
\q1
\v 29 Those who rejoice at the fall of the godly will be caught in a snare. 
\q2 Anguish will consume them before they die. 
\b
\q1
\v 30 Wrath and anger, these also are abominations. 
\q2 A sinner will possess them. 
\c 28  
\q1
\v 1 He who takes vengeance will find vengeance from the Lord, 
\q2 and he will surely make his sins firm. 
\q1
\v 2 Forgive your neighbor the hurt that he has done, 
\q2 and then your sins will be pardoned when you pray. 
\q1
\v 3 Does anyone harbor anger against another 
\q2 and expect healing from the Lord? 
\q1
\v 4 Upon a man like himself he has no mercy, 
\q2 and does he make supplication for his own sins? 
\q1
\v 5 He himself, being flesh, nourishes wrath. 
\q2 Who will make atonement for his sins? 
\q1
\v 6 Remember your last end, and stop enmity. 
\q2 Remember corruption and death, and be true to the commandments. 
\q1
\v 7 Remember the commandments, and don’t be angry with your neighbor. 
\q2 Remember the covenant of the Highest, and overlook ignorance. 
\b
\q1
\v 8 Abstain from strife, and you will diminish your sins, 
\q2 for a passionate man will kindle strife. 
\q1
\v 9 A man who is a sinner will trouble friends 
\q2 and sow discord among those who are at peace. 
\q1
\v 10 As is the fuel of the fire, so it will burn; 
\q2 and as the stoutness of the strife is, so it will burn. 
\q1 As is the strength of the man, so will be his wrath; 
\q2 and as is his wealth, so he will exalt his anger. 
\q1
\v 11 A contention begun in haste kindles a fire; 
\q2 and hasty fighting sheds blood. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 If you blow on a spark, it will burn; 
\q2 and if you spit upon it, it will be quenched. 
\q2 Both of these come out of your mouth. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 Curse the whisperer and double-tongued, 
\q2 for he has destroyed many who were at peace. 
\q1
\v 14 A slanderer has shaken many, 
\q2 and dispersed them from nation to nation. 
\q1 It has pulled down strong cities 
\q2 and overthrown the houses of great men. 
\q1
\v 15 A slanderer has cast out brave women 
\q2 and deprived them of their labors. 
\q1
\v 16 He who listens to it will not find rest, 
\q2 nor will he live quietly. 
\q1
\v 17 The stroke of a whip makes a mark in the flesh, 
\q2 but the stroke of a tongue will break bones. 
\q1
\v 18 Many have fallen by the edge of the sword, 
\q2 yet not so many as those who have fallen because of the tongue. 
\q1
\v 19 Happy is he who is sheltered from it, 
\q2 who has not passed through its wrath, 
\q2 who has not drawn its yoke, 
\q2 and has not been bound with its bands. 
\q1
\v 20 For its yoke is a yoke of iron, 
\q2 and its bands are bands of brass. 
\q1
\v 21 Its death is an evil death, 
\q2 and Hades is better than it. 
\q1
\v 22 It will not have rule over godly men. 
\q2 They will not be burned in its flame. 
\q1
\v 23 Those who forsake the Lord will fall into it. 
\q2 It will burn among them, and won’t be quenched. 
\q1 It will be sent against them like a lion. 
\q2 It will destroy them like a leopard. 
\q1
\v 24 As you hedge your possession about with thorns, 
\q2 and secure your silver and your gold, 
\q1
\v 25 so make a balance and a weight for your words, 
\q2 and make a door and a bar for your mouth. 
\q1
\v 26 Take heed lest you slip with it, 
\q2 lest you fall before one who lies in wait. 
\b
\c  29  
\q1
\v 1 He who shows mercy will lend to his neighbor. 
\q2 He who strengthens him with his hand keeps the commandments. 
\q1
\v 2 Lend to your neighbor in time of his need. 
\q2 Repay your neighbor on time. 
\q1
\v 3 Confirm your word, and keep faith with him; 
\q2 and at all seasons you will find what you need. 
\q1
\v 4 Many have considered a loan to be a windfall, 
\q2 and have given trouble to those who helped them. 
\q1
\v 5 Until he has received, he will kiss a man’s hands. 
\q2 For his neighbor’s money he will speak submissively. 
\q1 Then when payment is due, he will prolong the time, 
\q2 return excuses, and complain about the season. 
\q1
\v 6 If he prevails, the creditor will hardly receive half; 
\q2 and he will count it as a windfall. 
\q1 If not, he has deprived him of his money, 
\q2 and he has gotten him for an enemy without cause. 
\q1 He will pay him with cursing and railing. 
\q2 Instead of honor, he will pay him disgrace. 
\q1
\v 7 Many on account of fraud have turned away. 
\q2 They are afraid of being defrauded for nothing. 
\q1
\v 8 However be patient with a man in poor estate. 
\q2 Don’t keep him waiting for your alms. 
\q1
\v 9 Help a poor man for the commandment’s sake. 
\q2 According to his need don’t send him empty away. 
\q1
\v 10 Lose your money for a brother and a friend. 
\q2 Don’t let it rust under a stone and be lost. 
\q1
\v 11 Allocate your treasure according to the commandments of the Most High 
\q2 and it will profit you more than gold. 
\q1
\v 12 Store up almsgiving in your store-chambers 
\q2 and it will deliver you out of all affliction. 
\q1
\v 13 It will fight for you against your enemy 
\q2 better than a mighty shield and a ponderous spear. 
\b
\q1
\v 14 A good man will be surety for his neighbor. 
\q2 He who has lost shame will fail him. 
\q1
\v 15 Don’t forget the kindness of your guarantor, 
\q2 for he has given his life for you. 
\q1
\v 16 A sinner will waste the property of his guarantor. 
\q2
\v 17 He who is thankless will fail him who delivered him. 
\q1
\v 18 Being surety has undone many who were prospering 
\q2 and shaken them as a wave of the sea. 
\q1 It has driven mighty men from their homes. 
\q2 They wandered among foreign nations. 
\q1
\v 19 A sinner who falls into suretiship and undertakes contracts for work 
\q2 will fall into lawsuits. 
\q1
\v 20 Help your neighbor according to your power, 
\q2 and be careful not to fall yourself. 
\b
\q1
\v 21 The essentials of life are water, bread, 
\q2 a garment, and a house for privacy. 
\q1
\v 22 Better is the life of a poor man under a shelter of logs 
\q2 than sumptuous fare in another man’s house. 
\q1
\v 23 With little or with much, be well satisfied.\f + \fr 29:23  \ft The remainder of this verse is omitted by the best authorities. \f* 
\q1
\v 24 It is a miserable life to go from house to house. 
\q2 Where you are a guest, you dare not open your mouth. 
\q1
\v 25 You will entertain, serve drinks, and have no thanks. 
\q2 In addition to this, you will hear bitter words. 
\q1
\v 26 “Come here, you sojourner, set a table, 
\q2 and if you have anything in your hand, feed me with it.” 
\q1
\v 27 “Leave, you sojourner, for an honored guest is here. 
\q2 My brother has come to be my guest. I need my house.” 
\q1
\v 28 These things are grievous to a man of understanding: 
\q2 The scolding about lodging and the insults of creditors. 
\b
\c  30  
\q1
\v 1 He who loves his son will continue to lay stripes upon him, 
\q2 that he may have joy from him in the end. 
\q1
\v 2 He who chastises his son will have profit from him, 
\q2 and will brag about him among his acquaintances. 
\q1
\v 3 He who teaches his son will provoke his enemy to jealousy. 
\q2 Before friends, he will rejoice in him. 
\q1
\v 4 His father dies, and is as though he had not died; 
\q2 for he has left one behind him like himself. 
\q1
\v 5 In his life, he saw his son and rejoiced. 
\q2 When he died, it was without regret. 
\q1
\v 6 He left behind him an avenger against his enemies, 
\q2 and one to repay kindness to his friends. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 He who makes too much of his son will bind up his wounds. 
\q2 His heart will be troubled at every cry. 
\q1
\v 8 An unbroken horse becomes stubborn. 
\q2 An unrestrained son becomes headstrong. 
\q1
\v 9 Pamper your child, and he will make you afraid. 
\q2 Play with him, and he will grieve you.

\v 10 Don’t laugh with him, lest you have sorrow with him,

\v 14 Better is a poor man who is healthy and fit, 
\q2 than a rich man who is afflicted in his body. 
\q1
\v 15 Health and fitness are better than all gold, 
\q2 and a strong body better than wealth without measure. 
\q1
\v 16 There is no wealth better than health of body. 
\q2 There is no gladness above the joy of the heart. 
\q1
\v 17 Death is better than a bitter life, 
\q2 and eternal rest than a continual sickness. 
\b
\q1
\v 18 Good things poured out upon a mouth that is closed

\v 20 seeing with his eyes and groaning, 
\q2 like a eunuch embracing a virgin and groaning. 
\b
\q1
\v 21 Don’t give your soul to sorrow.

\v 22 Gladness of heart is the life of a man. 
\q2 Cheerfulness of a man lengthens his days. 
\q1
\v 23 Love your own soul, and comfort your heart. 
\q2 Remove sorrow far from you, 
\q2 for sorrow has destroyed many, 
\q2 and there is no profit in it. 
\q1
\v 24 Envy and wrath shorten life.

\v 25 Those who are cheerful and merry 
\q2 will benefit from their food. 
\c 31  
\q1
\v 1 Wakefulness that comes from riches consumes the flesh,

\v 3 A rich man toils in gathering money together. 
\q2 When he rests, he is filled with his good things. 
\q1
\v 4 A poor man toils in lack of substance. 
\q2 When he rests, he becomes needy.

\v 5 He who loves gold won’t be justified. 
\q2 He who follows destruction will himself have his fill of it. 
\q1
\v 6 Many have been given over to ruin for the sake of gold. 
\q2 Their destruction meets them face to face. 
\q1
\v 7 It is a stumbling block to those who sacrifice to it. 
\q2 Every fool will be taken by it. 
\q1
\v 8 Blessed is the rich person who is found blameless, 
\q2 and who doesn’t go after gold. 
\q1
\v 9 Who is he, that we may call him blessed? 
\q2 For he has done wonderful things among his people.

\v 10 Who has been tried by it, and found perfect? 
\q2 Then let him boast.

\v 12 Do you sit at a great table? Don’t be greedy there.

\q2 What has been created more greedy than an eye?

\q2 Don’t thrust yourself with it into the dish.

\v 19 How sufficient to a well-mannered man is a very little.

\q2 He rises early, and his wits are with him. 
\q1 The pain of wakefulness, colic,

\q2 rise up in the middle of it, and you shall have rest.

\v 23 People bless him who is liberal with his food.

\v 25 Don’t show yourself valiant in wine,

\v 27 Wine is as good as life to men,

\q1 What life is there to a man who is without wine? 
\q2 It has been created to make men glad. 
\q1
\v 28 Wine drunk in season and in moderation 
\q2 is joy of heart and gladness of soul:

\v 29 Wine drunk excessively is bitterness of soul,

\v 24 In the day that you end the days of your life, 
\q2 in the time of death, distribute your inheritance. 
\b
\q1
\v 25 Fodder, a stick, and burdens are for a donkey. 
\q2 Bread, discipline, and work are for a servant. 
\q1
\v 26 Set your slave to work, and you will find rest. 
\q2 Leave his hands idle, and he will seek liberty. 
\q1
\v 27 Yoke and thong will bow the neck. 
\q2 For an evil slave there are racks and tortures. 
\q1
\v 28 Send him to labor, that he not be idle, 
\q2 for idleness teaches much mischief. 
\q1
\v 29 Set him to work, as is fit for him. 
\q2 If he doesn’t obey, make his fetters heavy. 
\q1
\v 30 Don’t be excessive toward any. 
\q2 Do nothing unjust. 
\b
\q1
\v 31 If you have a slave, treat him like yourself, 
\q2 because you have bought him with blood. 
\q1
\v 32 If you have a slave, treat him like yourself. 
\q2 For like your own soul, you will need him. 
\q1 If you treat him ill, and he departs and runs away, 
\q2
\v 33 which way will you go to seek him?

\v 1 Vain and false hopes are for a man void of understanding. 
\q2 Dreams give wings to fools. 
\q1
\v 2 As one who grasps at a shadow and follows after the wind, 
\q2 so is he who sets his mind on dreams. 
\q1
\v 3 The vision of dreams is a reflection, 
\q2 the likeness of a face near a face. 
\q1
\v 4 From an unclean thing what can be cleansed? 
\q2 From that which is false what can be true? 
\q1
\v 5 Divinations, and soothsayings, and dreams, are vain. 
\q2 The heart has fantasies like a woman in labor. 
\q1
\v 6 If they are not sent in a visitation from the Most High, 
\q2 don’t give your heart to them. 
\q1
\v 7 For dreams have led many astray. 
\q2 They have failed by putting their hope in them. 
\q1
\v 8 Without lying the law will be fulfilled. 
\q2 Wisdom is complete in a faithful mouth. 
\b
\q1
\v 9 A well-instructed man knows many things. 
\q2 He who has much experience will declare understanding. 
\q1
\v 10 He who has no experience knows few things. 
\q2 But he who has traveled increases cleverness. 
\q1
\v 11 I have seen many things in my travels. 
\q2 My understanding is more than my words. 
\q1
\v 12 I was often in danger even to death. 
\q2 I was preserved because of these experiences. 
\q1
\v 13 The spirit of those who fear the Lord will live, 
\q2 for their hope is in him who saves them. 
\q1
\v 14 Whoever fears the Lord won’t be afraid, and won’t be a coward, 
\q2 for he is his hope. 
\q1
\v 15 Blessed is the soul of him who fears the Lord. 
\q2 To whom does he give heed? Who is his support? 
\q1
\v 16 The eyes of the Lord are on those who love him, 
\q2 a mighty protection and strong support, 
\q2 a cover from the hot blast, a shade from the noonday sun, 
\q2 a guard from stumbling, and a help from falling. 
\q1
\v 17 He raises up the soul, and enlightens the eyes. 
\q2 He gives health, life, and blessing. 
\b
\q1
\v 18 He who sacrifices a thing wrongfully gotten, his offering is made in mockery. 
\q2 The mockeries of wicked men are not acceptable. 
\q1
\v 19 The Most High has no pleasure in the offerings of the ungodly, 
\q2 Neither is he pacified for sins by the multitude of sacrifices. 
\q1
\v 20 Like one who kills a son before his father’s eyes 
\q2 is he who brings a sacrifice from the goods of the poor. 
\q1
\v 21 The bread of the needy is the life of the poor. 
\q2 He who deprives him of it is a man of blood. 
\q1
\v 22 Like one who murders his neighbor is he who takes away his living. 
\q2 Like a shedder of blood is he who deprives a hireling of his hire. 
\b
\q1
\v 23 When one builds, and another pulls down, 
\q2 what profit do they have but toil? 
\q1
\v 24 When one prays, and another curses, 
\q2 whose voice will the Lord listen to? 
\q1
\v 25 He who washes himself after touching a dead body, and touches it again, 
\q2 what does he gain by his washing? 
\q1
\v 26 Even so a man fasting for his sins, 
\q2 and going again, and doing the same, 
\q2 who will listen to his prayer? 
\q2 What profit does he have in his humiliation? 
\b
\c  35  
\q1
\v 1 He who keeps the law multiplies offerings. 
\q2 He who heeds the commandments sacrifices a peace offering. 
\q1
\v 2 He who returns a kindness offers fine flour. 
\q2 He who gives alms sacrifices a thank offering. 
\q1
\v 3 To depart from wickedness pleases the Lord. 
\q2 To depart from unrighteousness is an atoning sacrifice. 
\q1
\v 4 See that you don’t appear in the presence of the Lord empty. 
\q2
\v 5 For all these things are done because of the commandment. 
\q1
\v 6 The offering of the righteous enriches the altar. 
\q2 The sweet fragrance of it is before the Most High. 
\q1
\v 7 The sacrifice of a righteous man is acceptable. 
\q2 It won’t be forgotten. 
\q1
\v 8 Glorify the Lord with generosity. 
\q2 Don’t reduce the first fruits of your hands. 
\q1
\v 9 In every gift show a cheerful countenance, 
\q1 And dedicate your tithe with gladness. 
\q1
\v 10 Give to the Most High according as he has given. 
\q2 As your hand has found, give generously. 
\q1
\v 11 For the Lord repays, 
\q2 and he will repay you sevenfold. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 Don’t plan to bribe him with gifts, for he will not receive them. 
\q2 Don’t set your mind on an unrighteous sacrifice, 
\q2 For the Lord is the judge, 
\q2 and with him is no respect of persons. 
\q1
\v 13 He won’t accept any person against a poor man. 
\q2 He will listen to the prayer of him who is wronged. 
\q1
\v 14 He will in no way despise the supplication of the fatherless 
\q2 or the widow, when she pours out her tale. 
\q1
\v 15 Don’t the tears of the widow run down her cheek? 
\q2 Isn’t her cry against him who has caused them to fall? 
\q1
\v 16 He who serves God according to his good pleasure will be accepted. 
\q2 His supplication will reach to the clouds. 
\q1
\v 17 The prayer of the humble pierces the clouds. 
\q2 until it comes near, he will not be comforted. 
\q1 He won’t depart until the Most High visits 
\q2 and he judges righteously and executes judgment. 
\q1
\v 18 And the Lord will not be slack, neither will he be patient toward them, 
\q2 until he has crushed the loins of the unmerciful. 
\q1 He will repay vengeance to the heathen 
\q2 until he has taken away the multitude of the arrogant 
\q2 and broken in pieces the sceptres of the unrighteous, 
\q2
\v 19 until he has rendered to every man according to his deeds, 
\q2 and repaid the works of men according to their plans, 
\q2 until he has judged the cause of his people, 
\q2 and he will make them rejoice in his mercy.

\v 18 The belly will eat any food,

\v 19 The mouth tastes meats taken in hunting,

\v 20 A contrary heart will cause heaviness. 
\q2 A man of experience will pay him back. 
\q1
\v 21 A woman will receive any man,

\v 22 The beauty of a woman cheers the countenance. 
\q2 A man desires nothing more.

\v 23 If kindness and humility are on her tongue,

\q1
\v 24 He who gets a wife gets his richest treasure,

\v 25 Where no hedge is, the property will be plundered. 
\q2 He who has no wife will mourn as he wanders.

\v 1 Every friend will say, “I also am his friend”; 
\q2 but there is a friend which is only a friend in name. 
\q1
\v 2 Isn’t there a grief in it even to death 
\q2 when a companion and friend is turned into an enemy? 
\q1
\v 3 O wicked imagination, why were you formed 
\q2 to cover the dry land with deceit? 
\q1
\v 4 There is a companion who rejoices in the gladness of a friend, 
\q2 but in time of affliction will be against him. 
\q1
\v 5 There is a companion who for the belly’s sake labors with his friend, 
\q2 yet in the face of battle will carry his buckler.

\v 6 Don’t forget a friend in your soul. 
\q2 Don’t be unmindful of him in your riches.

\q1
\v 7 Every counselor extols counsel, 
\q2 but some give counsel in their own interest. 
\q1
\v 8 Let your soul beware of a counselor, 
\q2 and know in advance what is his interest 
\q2 (for he will take counsel for himself), 
\q2 lest he cast the lot against you, 
\q2
\v 9 and say to you, “Your way is good.” 
\q2 Then he will stand near you, to see what will happen to you. 
\q1
\v 10 Don’t take counsel with one who looks askance at you. 
\q2 Hide your counsel from those who are jealous of you. 
\q1
\v 11 Don’t consult with a woman about her rival, 
\q2 with a coward about war, 
\q2 with a merchant about business, 
\q2 with a buyer about selling, 
\q2 with an envious man about thankfulness, 
\q2 with an unmerciful man about kindliness, 
\q2 with a sluggard about any kind of work, 
\q2 with a hireling in your house about finishing his work, 
\q2 or with an idle servant about much business. 
\q2 Pay no attention to these in any matter of counsel. 
\q1
\v 12 But rather be continually with a godly man, 
\q2 whom you know to be a keeper of the commandments, 
\q2 who in his soul is as your own soul, 
\q2 and who will grieve with you, if you fail. 
\q1
\v 13 Make the counsel of your heart stand, 
\q2 for there is no one more faithful to you than it. 
\q1
\v 14 For a man’s soul is sometimes inclined to inform him 
\q2 better than seven watchmen who sit on high on a watch-tower. 
\q1
\v 15 Above all this ask the Most High 
\q2 that he may direct your way in truth. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 Let reason be the beginning of every work. 
\q2 Let counsel go before every action. 
\q1
\v 17 As a token of the changing of the heart, 
\q2
\v 18 four kinds of things rise up: 
\q2 good and evil, life and death. 
\q2 That which rules over them continually is the tongue. 
\q1
\v 19 There is one who is clever and the instructor of many, 
\q2 and yet is unprofitable to his own soul. 
\q1
\v 20 There is one who is subtle in words, and is hated. 
\q2 He will be destitute of all food. 
\q1
\v 21 For grace was not given to him from the Lord, 
\q2 because he is deprived of all wisdom. 
\q1
\v 22 There is one who is wise to his own soul; 
\q2 and the fruits of his understanding are trustworthy in the mouth. 
\q1
\v 23 A wise man will instruct his own people. 
\q2 The fruits of his understanding are trustworthy. 
\q1
\v 24 A wise man will be filled with blessing. 
\q2 All those who see him will call him happy. 
\q1
\v 25 The life of a man is counted by days. 
\q2 The days of Israel are innumerable. 
\q1
\v 26 The wise man will inherit confidence among his people. 
\q2 His name will live forever. 
\b
\q1
\v 27 My son, test your soul in your life. 
\q2 See what is evil for it, and don’t give in to it. 
\q1
\v 28 For not all things are profitable for all men. 
\q2 Not every soul has pleasure in everything. 
\q1
\v 29 Don’t be insatiable in any luxury. 
\q2 Don’t be greedy in the things that you eat. 
\q1
\v 30 For overeating brings disease, 
\q2 and gluttony causes nausea. 
\q1
\v 31 Because of gluttony, many have perished, 
\q2 but he who takes heed shall prolong his life. 
\b
\c  38  
\q1
\v 1 Honor a physician according to your need with the honors due to him, 
\q2 for truly the Lord has created him. 
\q1
\v 2 For healing comes from the Most High, 
\q2 and he shall receive a gift from the king. 
\q1
\v 3 The skill of the physician will lift up his head. 
\q2 He will be admired in the sight of great men. 
\q1
\v 4 The Lord created medicines out of the earth. 
\q2 A prudent man will not despise them. 
\q1
\v 5 Wasn’t water made sweet with wood, 
\q3 that its power might be known? 
\q1
\v 6 He gave men skill 
\q2 that he might be glorified in his marvelous works. 
\q1
\v 7 With them he heals 
\q2 and takes away pain. 
\q1
\v 8 With these, the pharmacist makes a mixture. 
\q2 God’s works won’t be brought to an end. 
\q2 From him, peace is upon the face of the earth. 
\b
\q1
\v 9 My son, in your sickness don’t be negligent, 
\q2 but pray to the Lord, and he will heal you. 
\q1
\v 10 Put away wrong doing, and direct your hands in righteousness. 
\q2 Cleanse your heart from all sin. 
\q1
\v 11 Give a sweet savor and a memorial of fine flour, 
\q2 and pour oil on your offering, according to your means. 
\q1
\v 12 Then give place to the physician, for truly the Lord has created him. 
\q2 Don’t let him leave you, for you need him. 
\q1
\v 13 There is a time when in recovery is in their hands. 
\q2
\v 14 For they also shall ask the Lord 
\q2 to prosper them in diagnosis and in healing for the maintenance of life. 
\q1
\v 15 He who sins before his Maker, 
\q2 let him fall into the hands of the physician. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 My son, let your tears fall over the dead, 
\q2 and as one who suffers grievously, begin lamentation. 
\q2 Wind up his body with due honor. 
\q2 Don’t neglect his burial. 
\q1
\v 17 Make bitter weeping and make passionate wailing. 
\q2 Let your mourning be according to his merit, 
\q2 for one day or two, lest you be spoken evil of; 
\q2 and so be comforted for your sorrow. 
\q1
\v 18 For from sorrow comes death. 
\q2 Sorrow of heart saps one’s strength. 
\q1
\v 19 In calamity, sorrow also remains. 
\q2 A poor man’s life is grievous to the heart. 
\q1
\v 20 Don’t give your heart to sorrow. 
\q2 Put it away, remembering the end. 
\q1
\v 21 Don’t forget it, for there is no returning again. 
\q2 You do him no good, and you would harm yourself. 
\q1
\v 22 Remember his end, for so also will yours be: 
\q2 yesterday for me, and today for you. 
\q1
\v 23 When the dead is at rest, let his remembrance rest. 
\q2 Be comforted for him when his spirit departs from him. 
\b
\q1
\v 24 The wisdom of the scribe comes by the opportunity of leisure. 
\q2 He who has little business can become wise. 
\q1
\v 25 How could he become wise who holds the plow, 
\q2 who glories in the shaft of the goad, 
\q2 who drives oxen and is occupied in their labors, 
\q2 and who mostly talks about bulls? 
\q1
\v 26 He will set his heart upon turning his furrows. 
\q2 His lack of sleep is to give his heifers their fodder. 
\q1
\v 27 So is every craftsman and master artisan 
\q2 who passes his time by night as by day, 
\q2 those who cut engravings of signets. 
\q1 His diligence is to make great variety. 
\q2 He sets his heart to preserve likeness in his portraiture, 
\q2 and is careful to finish his work. 
\q1
\v 28 So too is the smith sitting by the anvil 
\q2 and considering the unwrought iron. 
\q1 The smoke of the fire will waste his flesh. 
\q2 He toils in the heat of the furnace. 
\q1 The noise of the hammer deafens his ear. 
\q2 His eyes are upon the pattern of the object. 
\q1 He will set his heart upon perfecting his works. 
\q2 He will be careful to adorn them perfectly. 
\q1
\v 29 So is the potter sitting at his work 
\q2 and turning the wheel around with his feet, 
\q2 who is always anxiously set at his work. 
\q2 He produces his handiwork in quantity. 
\q1
\v 30 He will fashion the clay with his arm 
\q2 and will bend its strength in front of his feet. 
\q1 He will apply his heart to finish the glazing. 
\q2 He will be careful to clean the kiln. 
\b
\q1
\v 31 All these put their trust in their hands. 
\q2 Each becomes skillful in his own work. 
\q1
\v 32 Without these no city would be inhabited. 
\q2 Men wouldn’t reside as foreigners or walk up and down there. 
\q1
\v 33 They won’t be sought for in the council of the people. 
\q2 They won’t mount on high in the assembly. 
\q2 They won’t sit on the seat of the judge. 
\q2 They won’t understand the covenant of judgment. 
\q2 Neither will they declare instruction and judgment. 
\q2 They won’t be found where parables are. 
\q1
\v 34 But they will maintain the fabric of the age. 
\q2 Their prayer is in the handiwork of their craft. 
\b
\c  39  
\q1
\v 1 Not so he who has applied his soul 
\q2 and meditates in the law of the Most High. 
\q1 He will seek out the wisdom of all the ancients 
\q2 and will be occupied with prophecies. 
\q1
\v 2 He will keep the sayings of the men of renown 
\q2 and will enter in amidst the subtleties of parables. 
\q1
\v 3 He will seek out the hidden meaning of proverbs 
\q2 and be conversant in the dark sayings of parables. 
\q1
\v 4 He will serve among great men 
\q2 and appear before him who rules. 
\q1 He will travel through the land of foreign nations, 
\q2 for he has learned what is good and evil among men. 
\q1
\v 5 He will apply his heart to return early to the Lord who made him, 
\q2 and will make supplication before the Most High, 
\q2 and will open his mouth in prayer, 
\q2 and will ask for pardon for his sins. 
\b
\q1
\v 6 If the great Lord wills, 
\q2 he will be filled with the spirit of understanding; 
\q2 he will pour forth the words of his wisdom 
\q2 and in prayer give thanks to the Lord. 
\q1
\v 7 He will direct his counsel and knowledge, 
\q2 and he will meditate in his secrets. 
\q1
\v 8 He will show the instruction which he has been taught 
\q2 and will glory in the law of the covenant of the Lord. 
\q1
\v 9 Many will commend his understanding. 
\q2 So long as the world endures, it won’t be blotted out. 
\q1 His memory won’t depart. 
\q2 His name will live from generation to generation. 
\q1
\v 10 Nations will declare his wisdom. 
\q2 The congregation will proclaim his praise. 
\q1
\v 11 If he continues, he will leave a greater name than a thousand. 
\q2 If he finally rests, it is enough for him. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 Yet more I will utter, which I have thought about. 
\q2 I am filled like the full moon. 
\q1
\v 13 Listen to me, you holy children, 
\q2 and bud forth like a rose growing by a brook of water. 
\q1
\v 14 Give a sweet fragrance like frankincense. 
\q2 Put forth flowers like a lily. 
\q2 Scatter a sweet smell and sing a song of praise. 
\q2 Bless the Lord for all his works! 
\q1
\v 15 Magnify his name 
\q2 and give utterance to his praise 
\q2 with the songs on your lips and with harps! 
\q1 Say this when you utter his praise: 
\b
\q1
\v 16 All the works of the Lord are exceedingly good, 
\q2 and every command will be done in its time. 
\q1
\v 17 No one can say, “What is this?” “Why is that?” 
\q2 for at the proper time they will all be sought out. 
\q1 At his word, the waters stood as a heap, 
\q2 as did the reservoirs of water at the word of his mouth. 
\q1
\v 18 At his command all his good pleasure is fulfilled. 
\q2 There is no one who can hinder his salvation. 
\q1
\v 19 The works of all flesh are before him. 
\q2 It’s impossible to be hidden from his eyes. 
\q1
\v 20 He sees from everlasting to everlasting. 
\q2 There is nothing too wonderful for him. 
\q1
\v 21 No one can say, “What is this?” “Why is that?” 
\q2 for all things are created for their own uses. 
\b
\q1
\v 22 His blessing covered the dry land as a river 
\q2 and saturated it as a flood. 
\q1
\v 23 As he has made the waters salty, 
\q2 so the heathen will inherit his wrath. 
\q1
\v 24 His ways are plain to the holy. 
\q2 They are stumbling blocks to the wicked. 
\q1
\v 25 Good things are created from the beginning for the good. 
\q2 So are evil things for sinners. 
\q1
\v 26 The main things necessary for the life of man 
\q2 are water, fire, iron, salt, 
\q2 wheat flour, and honey, milk, 
\q2 the blood of the grape, oil, and clothing. 
\q1
\v 27 All these things are for good to the godly, 
\q2 but for sinners, they will be turned into evils. 
\b
\q1
\v 28 There are winds that are created for vengeance, 
\q2 and in their fury they lay on their scourges heavily. 
\q1 In the time of reckoning, they pour out their strength, 
\q2 and will appease the wrath of him who made them. 
\q1
\v 29 Fire, hail, famine, and death— 
\q2 all these are created for vengeance—

\v 30 wild beasts’ teeth, scorpions, adders, 
\q2 and a sword punishing the ungodly to destruction. 
\q1
\v 31 They will rejoice in his commandment, 
\q2 and will be made ready upon earth when needed. 
\q2 In their seasons, they won’t disobey his command. 
\b
\q1
\v 32 Therefore from the beginning I was convinced, 
\q2 and I thought it through and left it in writing: 
\q1
\v 33 All the works of the Lord are good. 
\q2 He will supply every need in its time. 
\q1
\v 34 No one can say, “This is worse than that,” 
\q2 for they will all be well approved in their time. 
\q1
\v 35 Now with all your hearts and voices, sing praises 
\q2 and bless the Lord’s name!

\v 1 Great travail is created for every man. 
\q2 A heavy yoke is upon the sons of Adam, 
\q2 from the day of their coming forth from their mother’s womb, 
\q2 until the day for their burial in the mother of all things. 
\q1
\v 2 The expectation of things to come, and the day of death, 
\q2 trouble their thoughts, and cause fear in their hearts. 
\q1
\v 3 From him who sits on a throne of glory, 
\q2 even to him who is humbled in earth and ashes, 
\q1
\v 4 from him who wears purple and a crown, 
\q2 even to him who is clothed in burlap, 
\q1
\v 5  there is wrath, jealousy, trouble, unrest, 
\q2 fear of death, anger, and strife. 
\q1 In the time of rest upon his bed, 
\q2 his night sleep changes his knowledge. 
\q1
\v 6 He gets little or no rest, 
\q2 and afterward in his sleep, as in a day of keeping watch, 
\q2 he is troubled in the vision of his heart, 
\q2 as one who has escaped from the front of battle. 
\q1
\v 7 In the very time of his deliverance, he awakens, 
\q2 and marvels that the fear is nothing. 
\b
\q1
\v 8  To all creatures, human and animal, 
\q2 and upon sinners sevenfold more, 
\q2
\v 9 come death, bloodshed, strife, sword, 
\q2 calamities, famine, suffering, and plague. 
\q1
\v 10 All these things were created for the wicked, 
\q2 and because of them the flood came. 
\q1
\v 11 All things that are of the earth turn to the earth again. 
\q2 All things that are of the waters return into the sea. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 All bribery and injustice will be blotted out. 
\q2 Good faith will stand forever. 
\q1
\v 13 The goods of the unjust will be dried up like a river, 
\q2 and like a great thunder in rain will go off in noise. 
\q1
\v 14 In opening his hands, a man will be made glad; 
\q2 so lawbreakers will utterly fail. 
\q1
\v 15 The children of the ungodly won’t grow many branches, 
\q2 and are as unhealthy roots on a sheer rock. 
\q1
\v 16 The reeds by every water or river bank 
\q2 will be plucked up before all grass. 
\q1
\v 17 Kindness is like a garden of blessings. 
\q2 Almsgiving endures forever. 
\b
\q1
\v 18 The life of one who labors and is content will be made sweet. 
\q2 He who finds a treasure is better than both. 
\q1
\v 19 Children and the building of a city establish a name. 
\q2 A blameless wife is better than both. 
\q1
\v 20 Wine and music rejoice the heart. 
\q2 The love of wisdom is better than both. 
\q1
\v 21 The pipe and the lute make pleasant melody. 
\q2 A pleasant tongue is better than both. 
\q1
\v 22 Your eye desires grace and beauty, 
\q2 but the green shoots of grain more than both. 
\q1
\v 23 A friend and a companion is always welcome, 
\q2 and a wife with her husband is better than both. 
\q1
\v 24 Relatives and helpers are for a time of affliction, 
\q2 but almsgiving rescues better than both. 
\q1
\v 25 Gold and silver will make the foot stand sure, 
\q2 and counsel is esteemed better than both. 
\q1
\v 26 Riches and strength will lift up the heart. 
\q2 The fear of the Lord is better than both. 
\q1 There is nothing lacking in the fear of the Lord. 
\q2 In it, there is no need to seek help. 
\q1
\v 27 The fear of the Lord is like a garden of blessing 
\q2 and covers a man more than any glory. 
\b
\q1
\v 28 My son, don’t lead a beggar’s life. 
\q2 It is better to die than to beg. 
\q1
\v 29 A man who looks to the table of another, 
\q2 his life is not to be considered a life. 
\q1 He will pollute his soul with another person’s food, 
\q2 but a wise and well-instructed person will beware of that. 
\q1
\v 30 Begging will be sweet in the mouth of the shameless, 
\q2 but it kindles a fire in his belly. 
\b
\c  41  
\q1
\v 1 O death, how bitter is the memory of you to a man who is at peace in his possessions, 
\q2 to the man who has nothing to distract him and has prosperity in all things, 
\q2 and who still has strength to enjoy food! 
\q1
\v 2 O death, your sentence is acceptable to a man who is needy and who fails in strength, 
\q2 who is in extreme old age, is distracted about all things, 
\q2 is perverse, and has lost patience! 
\q1
\v 3 Don’t be afraid of the sentence of death. 
\q2 Remember those who have been before you and who come after. 
\q1 This is the sentence from the Lord over all flesh. 
\q2
\v 4 And why do you refuse when it is the good pleasure of the Most High? 
\q1 Whether life lasts ten, or a hundred, or a thousand years, 
\q2 there is no inquiry about life in Hades.\f + \fr 41:4  \ft or, \fqa the place of the dead \ft or, \fqa Sheol\f* 
\b
\q1
\v 5 The children of sinners are abominable children 
\q2 and they frequent the dwellings of the ungodly. 
\q1
\v 6 The inheritance of sinners’ children will perish 
\q2 and with their posterity will be a perpetual disgrace. 
\q1
\v 7 Children will complain of an ungodly father, 
\q2 because they suffer disgrace because of him. 
\q1
\v 8 Woe to you, ungodly men, 
\q2 who have forsaken the law of the Most High God!\f + \fr 41:8  \ft The remainder of this verse is omitted by the best authorities.\f* 
\q1
\v 9 If you are born, you will be born to a curse. 
\q2 If you die, a curse will be your portion. 
\q1
\v 10 All things that are of the earth will go back to the earth; 
\q2 so the ungodly will go from a curse to perdition. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 The mourning of men is about their bodies; 
\q2 but the evil name of sinners will be blotted out. 
\q1
\v 12 Have regard for your name, 
\q2 for it continues with you longer than a thousand great treasures of gold. 
\q1
\v 13 A good life has its number of days, 
\q2 but a good name continues forever. 
\b
\q1
\v 14 My children, follow instruction in peace. 
\q2 But wisdom that is hidden and a treasure that is not seen, 
\q2 what benefit is in them both? 
\q1
\v 15 Better is a man who hides his foolishness 
\q2 than a man who hides his wisdom. 
\q1
\v 16 Therefore show respect for my words; 
\q2 for it is not good to retain every kind of shame. 
\q2 Not everything is approved by all in good faith. 
\b
\q1
\v 17 Be ashamed of sexual immorality before father and mother, 
\q2 of a lie before a prince and a mighty man, 
\q2
\v 18 of an offense before a judge and ruler, 
\q2 of iniquity before the congregation and the people, 
\q2 of unjust dealing before a partner and friend, 
\q2
\v 19 and of theft in the place where you sojourn. 
\q1 Be ashamed in regard of the truth of God and his covenant, 
\q2 of leaning on your elbow at dinner, 
\q2 of contemptuous behavior in the matter of giving and taking, 
\q2
\v 20 of silence before those who greet you, 
\q2 of looking at a woman who is a prostitute, 
\q2
\v 21 of turning away your face from a kinsman, 
\q2 of taking away a portion or a gift, 
\q2 of gazing at a woman who has a husband, 
\q2
\v 22 of meddling with his maid—and don’t come near her bed, 
\q2 of abusive speech to friends—and after you have given, don’t insult, 
\q2
\v 23 of repeating and speaking what you have heard, 
\q2 and of revealing of secrets. 
\q1
\v 24 So you will be ashamed of the right things 
\q2 and find favor in the sight of every man. 
\b
\c  42  
\q1
\v 1 Don’t be ashamed of these things, 
\q2 and don’t sin to save face: 
\q2
\v 2 of the law of the Most High and his covenant, 
\q2 of judgment to do justice to the ungodly, 
\q2
\v 3 of reckoning with a partner and with travellers, 
\q2 of a gift from the inheritance of friends, 
\q2
\v 4 of exactness of scales and weights, 
\q2 of getting much or little, 
\q2
\v 5 of bargaining dealing with merchants, 
\q2 of frequent correction of children, 
\q2 and of making the back of an evil slave to bleed. 
\q1
\v 6  A seal is good where an evil wife is. 
\q2 Where there are many hands, lock things up. 
\q1
\v 7 Whatever you hand over, let it be by number and weight. 
\q2 In giving and receiving, let all be in writing. 
\q1
\v 8  Don’t be ashamed to instruct the unwise and foolish, 
\q2 and one of extreme old age who contends with those who are young. 
\q1 So you will be well instructed indeed 
\q2 and approved in the sight of every living man. 
\b
\q1
\v 9 A daughter is a secret cause of wakefulness to a father. 
\q2 Care for her takes away sleep— 
\q2 in her youth, lest she pass the flower of her age; 
\q2 when she is married, lest she should be hated; 
\q2
\v 10 in her virginity, lest she should be defiled and be with child in her father’s house; 
\q2 when she has a husband, lest she should transgress; 
\q2 and when she is married, lest she should be barren. 
\q1
\v 11 Keep a strict watch over a headstrong daughter, 
\q2 lest she make you a laughingstock to your enemies, 
\q2 a byword in the city and notorious among the people, 
\q2 and shame you in public. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 Don’t gaze at every beautiful body. 
\q2 Don’t sit in the midst of women. 
\q1
\v 13 For from garments comes a moth, 
\q2 and from a woman comes a woman’s wickedness. 
\q1
\v 14 Better is the wickedness of a man than a pleasant woman, 
\q2 a woman who puts you to shame and disgrace. 
\b
\q1
\v 15 I will make mention now of the works of the Lord, 
\q2 and will declare the things that I have seen. 
\q2 The Lord’s works are in his words. 
\q1
\v 16 The sun that gives light looks at all things. 
\q2 The Lord’s work is full of his glory. 
\q1
\v 17 The Lord has not given power to the saints to declare all his marvelous works, 
\q2 which the Almighty Lord firmly settled, 
\q2 that the universe might be established in his glory. 
\q1
\v 18 He searches out the deep and the heart. 
\q2 He has understanding of their secrets. 
\q1 For the Most High knows all knowledge. 
\q2 He sees the signs of the world. 
\q1
\v 19 He declares the things that are past and the things that shall be, 
\q2 and reveals the traces of hidden things. 
\q1
\v 20 No thought escapes him. 
\q2 There is not a word hidden from him. 
\q1
\v 21 He has ordered the mighty works of his wisdom. 
\q2 He is from everlasting to everlasting. 
\q1 Nothing has been added to them, nor diminished from them. 
\q2 He had no need of any counselor. 
\q1
\v 22 How desirable are all his works! 
\q2 One may see this even in a spark. 
\q1
\v 23 All these things live and remain forever in all manner of uses. 
\q2 They are all obedient. 
\q1
\v 24 All things are in pairs, one opposite the other. 
\q2 He has made nothing imperfect. 
\q1
\v 25 One thing establishes the good things of another. 
\q2 Who could ever see enough of his glory? 
\b
\c  43  
\q1
\v 1 The pride of the heavenly heights is the clear sky, 
\q2 the appearance of heaven, in the spectacle of its glory. 
\q1
\v 2 The sun, when it appears, bringing tidings as it rises, 
\q2 is a marvelous instrument, the work of the Most High. 
\q1
\v 3 At noon, it dries up the land. 
\q2 Who can stand against its burning heat? 
\q1
\v 4 A man tending a furnace is in burning heat, 
\q2 but the sun three times more, burning up the mountains, 
\q2 breathing out fiery vapors, 
\q2 and sending out bright beams, it blinds the eyes. 
\q1
\v 5 Great is the Lord who made it. 
\q2 At his word, he hastens on its course. 
\b
\q1
\v 6 The moon marks the changing seasons, 
\q2 declares times, and is a sign for the world. 
\q1
\v 7 From the moon is the sign of feast days, 
\q2 a light that wanes when it completes its course. 
\q1
\v 8 The month is called after its name, 
\q2 increasing wonderfully in its changing— 
\q2 an instrument of the army on high, 
\q2 shining in the structure of heaven, 
\q2
\v 9 the beauty of heaven, the glory of the stars, 
\q2 an ornament giving light in the highest places of the Lord. 
\q1
\v 10 At the word of the Holy One, they will stand in due order. 
\q2 They won’t faint in their watches. 
\q1
\v 11 Look at the rainbow, and praise him who made it. 
\q2 It is exceedingly beautiful in its brightness. 
\q1
\v 12 It encircles the sky with its glorious circle. 
\q2 The hands of the Most High have stretched it out. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 By his commandment, he makes the snow fall 
\q2 and swiftly sends the lightnings of his judgment. 
\q1
\v 14 Therefore the storehouses are opened, 
\q2 and clouds fly out like birds. 
\q1
\v 15 By his mighty power, he makes the clouds strong 
\q2 and the hailstones are broken in pieces. 
\q1
\v 16 At his appearing, the mountains will be shaken. 
\q2 At his will, the south wind will blow. 
\q1
\v 17 The voice of his thunder rebukes the earth. 
\q2 So does the northern storm and the whirlwind. 
\q1 Like birds flying down, he sprinkles the snow. 
\q2 It falls down like the lighting of locusts. 
\q1
\v 18 The eye is dazzled at the beauty of its whiteness. 
\q2 The heart is amazed as it falls. 
\q1
\v 19 He also pours out frost on the earth like salt. 
\q2 When it is freezes, it has points like thorns. 
\b
\q1
\v 20 The cold north wind blows 
\q2 and ice freezes on the water. 
\q1 It settles on every pool of water. 
\q2 The water puts it on like it was a breastplate. 
\q1
\v 21 It will devour the mountains, burn up the wilderness, 
\q2 and consume the green grass like fire. 
\q1
\v 22 A mist coming speedily heals all things. 
\q2 A dew coming after heat brings cheerfulness. 
\b
\q1
\v 23 By his counsel, he has calmed the deep 
\q2 and planted islands in it. 
\q1
\v 24 Those who sail on the sea tell of its dangers. 
\q2 We marvel when we hear it with our ears. 
\q1
\v 25 There are also those strange and wondrous works in it— 
\q2 variety of all that has life and the huge creatures of the sea. 
\q1
\v 26 Because of him, his messengers succeed. 
\q2 By his word, all things hold together. 
\b
\q1
\v 27 We may say many things, but couldn’t say enough. 
\q2 The summary of our words is, “He is everything!” 
\q1
\v 28 How could we have strength to glorify him? 
\q2 For he is himself the greater than all his works. 
\q1
\v 29 The Lord is awesome and exceedingly great! 
\q2 His power is marvelous! 
\q1
\v 30 Glorify the Lord and exalt him as much as you can! 
\q2 For even yet, he will surpass that. 
\q1 When you exalt him, summon your full strength. 
\q2 Don’t be weary, because you can’t praise him enough. 
\q1
\v 31 Who has seen him, that he may describe him? 
\q2 Who can magnify him as he is? 
\q1
\v 32 Many things greater than these are hidden, 
\q2 for we have seen just a few of his works. 
\q1
\v 33 For the Lord made all things. 
\q2 He gave wisdom to the godly. 
\b
\c  44  
\q1
\v 1 Let us now praise famous men, 
\q2 our ancestors in their generations. 
\q1
\v 2 The Lord created great glory in them— 
\q2 his mighty power from the beginning. 
\q1
\v 3 Some ruled in their kingdoms 
\q2 and were men renowned for their power, 
\q2 giving counsel by their understanding. 
\q1 Some have spoken in prophecies, 
\q2
\v 4 leaders of the people by their counsels, 
\q2 and by their understanding, giving instruction for the people. 
\q2 Their words in their instruction were wise. 
\q1
\v 5 Some composed musical tunes, 
\q2 and set forth verses in writing, 
\q2
\v 6 rich men endowed with ability, 
\q2 living peaceably in their homes. 
\q1
\v 7 All these were honored in their generations, 
\q2 and were outstanding in their days. 
\q1
\v 8 Some of them have left a name behind them, 
\q2 so that others declare their praises. 
\q1
\v 9 But of others, there is no memory. 
\q2 They perished as though they had not been. 
\q2 They become as though they had not been born, 
\q2 they and their children after them. 
\q1
\v 10 But these were men of mercy, 
\q2 whose righteous deeds have not been forgotten. 
\q1
\v 11 A good inheritance remains with their offspring. 
\q2 Their children are within the covenant. 
\q1
\v 12 Their offspring stand fast, 
\q2 with their children, for their sakes. 
\q1
\v 13 Their offspring will remain forever. 
\q2 Their glory won’t be blotted out. 
\q1
\v 14 Their bodies were buried in peace. 
\q2 Their name lives to all generations. 
\q1
\v 15 People will declare their wisdom. 
\q2 The congregation proclaims their praise. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 Enoch pleased the Lord, and was taken up, 
\q2 an example of repentance to all generations. 
\b
\q1
\v 17 Noah was found perfect and righteous. 
\q2 In the season of wrath, he kept the race alive. 
\q1 Therefore a remnant was left on the earth 
\q2 when the flood came. 
\q1
\v 18 Everlasting covenants were made with him, 
\q2 that all flesh should no more be blotted out by a flood. 
\b
\q1
\v 19 Abraham was a great father of a multitude of nations. 
\q2 There was none found like him in glory, 
\q2
\v 20 who kept the law of the Most High, 
\q2 and was taken into covenant with him. 
\q1 In his flesh he established the covenant. 
\q2 When he was tested, he was found faithful. 
\q1
\v 21 Therefore he assured him by an oath 
\q2 that the nations would be blessed through his offspring, 
\q2 that he would multiply him like the dust of the earth, 
\q2 exalt his offspring like the stars, 
\q2 and cause them to inherit from sea to sea, 
\q2 and from the Euphrates River to the utmost parts of the earth. 
\b
\q1
\v 22 In Isaac also, he established the same assurance for Abraham his father’s sake, 
\q2 the blessing of all men, and the covenant. 
\q1
\v 23 He made it rest upon the head of Jacob. 
\q2 He acknowledged him in his blessings, 
\q2 gave to him by inheritance, 
\q2 and divided his portions. 
\q2 He distributed them among twelve tribes. 
\c 45  
\q1
\v 1 He brought out of him a man of mercy, 
\q2 who found favor in the sight of all people, 
\q2 a man loved by God and men, even Moses, 
\q2 whose memory is blessed. 
\q1
\v 2 He made him equal to the glory of the saints, 
\q2 and magnified him in the fears of his enemies. 
\q1
\v 3 By his words he caused the wonders to cease. 
\q2 God glorified him in the sight of kings. 
\q1 He gave him commandments for his people 
\q2 and showed him part of his glory. 
\q1
\v 4 He sanctified him in his faithfulness and meekness. 
\q2 He chose him out of all people. 
\q1
\v 5 He made him to hear his voice, 
\q2 led him into the thick darkness, 
\q2 and gave him commandments face to face, 
\q2 even the law of life and knowledge, 
\q2 that he might teach Jacob the covenant, 
\q2 and Israel his judgments. 
\b
\q1
\v 6 He exalted Aaron, a holy man like Moses, 
\q2 even his brother, of the tribe of Levi. 
\q1
\v 7 He established an everlasting covenant with him, 
\q2 and gave him the priesthood of the people. 
\q1 He blessed him with stateliness, 
\q2 and dressed him in a glorious robe. 
\q1
\v 8 He clothed him in perfect splendor, 
\q2 and strengthened him with symbols of authority: 
\q2 the linen trousers, the long robe, and the ephod. 
\q1
\v 9 He encircled him with pomegranates; 
\q2 with many golden bells around him, 
\q2 to make a sound as he went, 
\q2 to make a sound that might be heard in the temple, 
\q2 for a reminder for the children of his people; 
\q2
\v 10 with a holy garment, with gold, blue, and purple, the work of the embroiderer; 
\q2 with an oracle of judgment—Urim and Thummim; 
\q2
\v 11 with twisted scarlet, the work of the craftsman; 
\q2 with precious stones engraved like a signet, in a setting of gold, the work of the jeweller, 
\q2 for a reminder engraved in writing, after the number of the tribes of Israel; 
\q2
\v 12 with a crown of gold upon the mitre, having engraved on it, as on a signet, “HOLINESS”, 
\q2 an ornament of honor, the work of an expert, 
\q2 the desires of the eyes, goodly and beautiful. 
\q1
\v 13 Before him there never have been anything like it. 
\q2 No stranger put them on, but only his sons and his offspring perpetually. 
\q1
\v 14 His sacrifices shall be wholly burned, 
\q2 twice every day continually. 
\q1
\v 15 Moses consecrated him, 
\q2 and anointed him with holy oil. 
\q1 It was an everlasting covenant with him 
\q2 and to his offspring, all the days of heaven, 
\q2 to minister to the Lord, to serve as a priest, 
\q2 and to bless his people in his name. 
\q1
\v 16 He chose him out of all living 
\q2 to offer sacrifice to the Lord— 
\q2 incense, and a sweet fragrance, for a memorial, 
\q2 to make atonement for your people. 
\q1
\v 17 He gave to him in his commandments, 
\q2 authority in the covenants of judgments, 
\q2 to teach Jacob the testimonies, 
\q2 and to enlighten Israel in his law. 
\q1
\v 18 Strangers conspired against him 
\q2 and envied him in the wilderness: 
\q2 Dathan and Abiram with their company, 
\q2 and the congregation of Korah, with wrath and anger. 
\q1
\v 19 The Lord saw it, and it displeased him. 
\q2 In the wrath of his anger, they were destroyed. 
\q1 He did wonders upon them, 
\q2 to consume them with flaming fire. 
\q1
\v 20 He added glory to Aaron, 
\q2 and gave him a heritage. 
\q1 He divided to him the first fruits of the increase, 
\q2 and prepared bread of first fruits in abundance. 
\q1
\v 21 For they eat the sacrifices of the Lord, 
\q2 which he gave to him and to his offspring. 
\q1
\v 22 However, in the land of the people, he has no inheritance, 
\q2 and he has no portion among the people, 
\q2 for the Lord himself is your portion and inheritance. 
\b
\q1
\v 23 Phinehas the son of Eleazar is the third in glory, 
\q2 in that he was zealous in the fear of the Lord, 
\q2 and stood fast when the people turned away, 
\q2 and he made atonement for Israel. 
\q1
\v 24 Therefore, a covenant of peace was established for him, 
\q2 that he should be leader of the sanctuary and of his people, 
\q2 that he and his offspring should have the dignity of the priesthood forever. 
\q1
\v 25 Also he made a covenant with David the son of Jesse, of the tribe of Judah. 
\q2 The inheritance of the king is his alone from son to son. 
\q2 So the inheritance of Aaron is also to his seed. 
\b
\q1
\v 26  May God give you wisdom in your heart 
\q2 to judge his people in righteousness, 
\q2 that their good things may not be abolished, 
\q2 and that their glory may endure for all their generations. 
\b
\c  46

\v 1 Joshua the son of Nun was valiant in war,

\q1 He was made great according to his name 
\q2 for the saving of\f + \fr 46:1  \ft Gr. \fqa his. \f* God’s elect, 
\q2 to take vengeance on the enemies that rose up against them, 
\q2 that he might give Israel their inheritance. 
\q1
\v 2 How was he glorified in the lifting up his hands, 
\q2 and in stretching out his sword against the cities! 
\q1
\v 3 Who before him stood so firm? 
\q2 For the Lord himself brought his enemies to him. 
\q1
\v 4 Didn’t the sun go back by his hand? 
\q2 Didn’t one day become as two? 
\q1
\v 5 He called upon the Most High, the Mighty One, 
\q2 when his foes pressed in all around him, 
\q2 and the great Lord heard him. 
\q1
\v 6 With hailstones of mighty power, 
\q2 he caused war to break violently upon the nation, 
\q2 and\f + \fr 46:6  \ft See Joshua 10:11 \f* on the slope he destroyed those who resisted, 
\q2 so that the nations might know his armor, 
\q2 how he fought in the sight of the Lord; 
\q2 for he followed the Mighty One. 
\q1
\v 7 Also in the time of Moses, he did a work of mercy— 
\q2 he and Caleb the son of Jephunneh— 
\q2 in that they withstood the adversary, 
\q2 hindered the people from sin, 
\q2 and stilled their wicked complaining. 
\q1
\v 8 And of six hundred thousand people on foot, they two alone were preserved 
\q2 to bring them into their inheritance, 
\q2 into a land flowing with milk and honey. 
\q1
\v 9 The Lord gave strength to Caleb, 
\q2 and it remained with him to his old age, 
\q2 so that he entered the hill country, 
\q2 and his offspring obtained it for an inheritance, 
\q2
\v 10 that all the children of Israel might see that it is good to follow the Lord. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 Also the judges, every one by his name, 
\q2 all whose hearts didn’t engage in immorality, 
\q2 and who didn’t turn away from the Lord—

\v 12 May their bones flourish again out of their place. 
\q2 May the name of those who have been honored be renewed in their children.

\v 13 Samuel, the prophet of the Lord, loved by his Lord, 
\q2 established a kingdom and anointed princes over his people. 
\q1
\v 14 By the law of the Lord he judged the congregation, 
\q2 and the Lord watched over Jacob. 
\q1
\v 15 By his faithfulness he was proved to be a prophet. 
\q2 By his words he was known to be faithful in vision. 
\q1
\v 16 When his enemies pressed on him on every side, 
\q2 he called upon the Lord, the Mighty One, 
\q2 with the offering of the suckling lamb. 
\q1
\v 17 Then the Lord thundered from heaven. 
\q2 He made his voice heard with a mighty sound. 
\q1
\v 18 He utterly destroyed the rulers of the Tyrians 
\q2 and all the princes of the Philistines. 
\q1
\v 19 Before the time of his age-long sleep, 
\q2 he testified in the sight of the lord and his anointed, 
\q2 “I have not taken any man’s goods, so much as a sandal;” 
\q2 and no one accused him. 
\q1
\v 20 Even after he fell asleep, he prophesied, 
\q2 and showed the king his end, 
\q2 and lifted up his voice from the earth in prophecy, 
\q2 to blot out the wickedness of the people. 
\b

\q1
\v 1 After him, Nathan rose up 
\q2 to prophesy in the days of David. 
\q1
\v 2 As is the fat when it is separated from the peace offering, 
\q2 so was David separated from the children of Israel. 
\q1
\v 3 He played with lions as with kids, 
\q2 and with bears as with lambs of the flock. 
\q1
\v 4 In his youth didn’t he kill a giant, 
\q2 and take away reproach from the people 
\q2 when he lifted up his hand with a sling stone, 
\q2 and beat down the boasting Goliath? 
\q1
\v 5 For he called upon the Most High Lord, 
\q2 and he gave him strength in his right hand 
\q2 to kill a man mighty in war, 
\q2 to exalt the horn of his people. 
\q1
\v 6 So they glorified him for his tens of thousands, 
\q2 and praised him for the blessings of the Lord, 
\q2 in that a glorious diadem was given to him. 
\q1
\v 7 For he destroyed the enemies on every side, 
\q2 and defeated the Philistines his adversaries. 
\q2 He broke their horn in pieces to this day. 
\q1
\v 8 In every work of his he gave thanks to the Holy One Most High with words of glory. 
\q2 He sang praise with his whole heart, 
\q2 and loved him who made him. 
\q1
\v 9 He set singers before the altar, 
\q2 to make sweet melody by their music.\f + \fr 47:9  \ft The remainder of this verse is omitted by the best authorities. \f* 
\q1
\v 10 He gave beauty to the feasts, 
\q2 and set in order the seasons to completion 
\q2 while they praised his holy name, 
\q2 and the sanctuary resounded from early morning. 
\q1
\v 11 The Lord took away his sins, 
\q2 and exalted his horn forever. 
\q1 He gave him a covenant of kings, 
\q2 and a glorious throne in Israel. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 After him a wise son rose up, 
\q2 who because of him lived in security. 
\q1
\v 13 Solomon reigned in days of peace. 
\q2 God gave him rest all around, 
\q2 that he might set up a house for his name, 
\q2 and prepare a sanctuary forever. 
\q1
\v 14 How wise you were made in your youth, 
\q2 and filled as a river with understanding! 
\q1
\v 15 Your influence covered the earth, 
\q2 and you filled it with parables and riddles. 
\q1
\v 16 Your name reached to the far away islands, 
\q2 and you were loved for your peace. 
\q1
\v 17 For your songs, proverbs, parables, 
\q2 and interpretations, the countries marveled at you. 
\q1
\v 18 By the name of the Lord God, 
\q2 who is called the God of Israel, 
\q2 you gathered gold like tin, 
\q2 and multiplied silver like lead. 
\q1
\v 19 You bowed your loins to women, 
\q2 and in your body you were brought into subjection. 
\q1
\v 20 You blemished your honor, 
\q2 and defiled your offspring, 
\q2 to bring wrath upon your children. 
\q2 I was grieved for your folly, 
\q2
\v 21 because the sovereignty was divided, 
\q2 and a disobedient kingdom ruled out of Ephraim. 
\q1
\v 22 But the Lord will never forsake his mercy. 
\q2 He won’t destroy any of his works, 
\q2 nor blot out the posterity of his elect. 
\q1 He won’t take away the offspring him who loved him. 
\q2 He gave a remnant to Jacob, 
\q2 and to David a root from his own family. 
\b
\q1
\v 23 So Solomon rested with his fathers. 
\q2 Of his offspring, he left behind him Rehoboam, 
\q2 the foolishness of the people, and one who lacked understanding, 
\q2 who made the people revolt by his counsel. 
\q1 Also Jeroboam the son of Nebat, 
\q2 who made Israel to sin, 
\q2 and gave a way of sin to Ephraim. 
\q1
\v 24 Their sins were multiplied exceedingly, 
\q2 until they were removed from their land. 
\q1
\v 25 For they sought out all manner of wickedness, 
\q2 until vengeance came upon them. 
\b
\c  48  
\q1
\v 1 Then Elijah arose, the prophet like fire. 
\q2 His word burned like a torch. 
\q1
\v 2 He brought a famine upon them, 
\q2 and by his zeal made them few in number. 
\q1
\v 3 By the word of the Lord he shut up the heavens. 
\q2 He brought down fire three times. 
\q1
\v 4 How you were glorified, O Elijah, in your wondrous deeds! 
\q2 Whose glory is like yours? 
\q1
\v 5 You raised up a dead man from death, 
\q2 from Hades, by the word of the Most High. 
\q1
\v 6 You brought down kings to destruction, 
\q2 and honorable men from their sickbeds. 
\q1
\v 7 You heard rebuke in Sinai, 
\q2 and judgments of vengeance in Horeb. 
\q1
\v 8 You anointed kings for retribution, 
\q2 and prophets to succeed after you. 
\q1
\v 9 You were taken up in a tempest of fire, 
\q2 in a chariot of fiery horses. 
\q1
\v 10 You were recorded for reproofs in their seasons, 
\q2 to pacify anger, before it broke out into wrath, 
\q2 to turn the heart of the father to the son, 
\q2 and to restore the tribes of Jacob. 
\q1
\v 11 Blessed are those who saw you, 
\q2 and those who have been beautified with love; 
\q2 for we also shall surely live. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 Elijah was wrapped in a whirlwind. 
\q2 Elisha was filled with his spirit. 
\q2 In his days he was not moved by the fear of any ruler, 
\q2 and no one brought him into subjection. 
\q1
\v 13 Nothing was too hard for him. 
\q2 When he was buried, his body prophesied. 
\q1
\v 14 As in his life he did wonders, 
\q2 so his works were also marvelous in death. 
\q1
\v 15 For all this the people didn’t repent. 
\q2 They didn’t depart from their sins, 
\q2 until they were carried away as a plunder from their land, 
\q2 and were scattered through all the earth. 
\q1 The people were left very few in number, 
\q2 but with a ruler from the house of David. 
\q1
\v 16 Some of them did that which was right, 
\q2 but some multiplied sins. 
\b
\q1
\v 17 Hezekiah fortified his city, 
\q2 and brought water into its midst. 
\q1 He tunneled through rock with iron, 
\q2 and built cisterns for water. 
\q1
\v 18 In his days Sennacherib invaded, 
\q2 and sent Rabshakeh, and departed. 
\q1 He lifted up his hand against Zion, 
\q2 and boasted great things in his arrogance. 
\q1
\v 19 Then their hearts and their hands were shaken, 
\q2 and they were in pain, as women in labor. 
\q1
\v 20 But they called upon the Lord who is merciful, 
\q2 spreading out their hands to him. 
\q1 The Holy One quickly heard them out of Heaven, 
\q2 and delivered them by the hand of Isaiah. 
\q1
\v 21 He struck the camp of the Assyrians, 
\q2 and his angel utterly destroyed them. 
\q1
\v 22 For Hezekiah did that which was pleasing to the Lord, 
\q2 and was strong in the ways of his ancestor David, 
\q2 which Isaiah the prophet commanded, 
\q2 who was great and faithful in his vision. 
\b
\q1
\v 23 In his days the sun went backward. 
\q2 He prolonged the life of the king. 
\q1
\v 24 He saw by an excellent spirit what would come to pass in the future; 
\q2 and he comforted those who mourned in Zion. 
\q1
\v 25 He showed the things that would happen through the end of time, 
\q2 and the hidden things before they came.

\v 1 The memory of Josiah is like the composition of incense 
\q2 prepared by the work of the perfumer. 
\q1 It will be sweet as honey in every mouth, 
\q2 and like music at a banquet of wine. 
\q1
\v 2 He did what was right in the reforming of the people, 
\q2 and took away the abominations of iniquity. 
\q1
\v 3 He set his heart right toward the Lord. 
\q2 In lawless days, he made godliness prevail. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Except David, Hezekiah, and Josiah, 
\q2 all were wicked, 
\q2 because they abandoned the law of the Most High. 
\q2 The kings of Judah came to an end. 
\q1
\v 5 They gave their power to others, 
\q2 and their glory to a foreign nation. 
\q1
\v 6 They set the chosen city of the sanctuary on fire 
\q2 and made her streets desolate, as it was written by the hand of Jeremiah. 
\q1
\v 7 For they mistreated him; 
\q2 yet he was sanctified in the womb to be a prophet, 
\q2 to root out, to afflict, to destroy 
\q2 and likewise to build and to plant. 
\b
\q1
\v 8 Ezekiel saw the vision of glory, 
\q2 which God showed him on the chariot of the cherubim. 
\q1
\v 9 For truly he remembered the enemies in rainstorm,

\q1
\v 10 Also of the twelve prophets,\f + \fr 49:10  \ft The remainder of this line is omitted by the best authorities. \f*

\v 11 How shall we magnify Zerubbabel?

\v 14 No man was created upon the earth like Enoch, 
\q2 for he was taken up from the earth.

\v 15 Nor was there a man born like Joseph,

\v 1  It was Simon, the son of Onias, the high priest,

\v 2 The foundation was built by him to the height of the double walls, 
\q2 the lofty retaining walls of the temple enclosure. 
\q1
\v 3 In his days, a water cistern was dug, 
\q2 the brazen vessel like the sea in circumference. 
\q1
\v 4  He planned to save his people from ruin, 
\q2 and fortified the city against siege. 
\q1
\v 5 How glorious he was when the people gathered around him 
\q2 as he came out of the house of the veil! 
\q1
\v 6 He was like the morning star among clouds, 
\q2 like the full moon, 
\q2
\v 7 like the sun shining on the temple of the Most High, 
\q2 like the rainbow shining in clouds of glory, 
\q2
\v 8 like roses in the days of first fruits, 
\q2 like lilies by a water spring,

\v 9 like fire and incense in the censer, 
\q2 like a vessel of beaten gold adorned with all kinds of precious stones, 
\q2
\v 10 like an olive tree loaded with fruit, 
\q2 and like a cypress growing high among the clouds. 
\q1
\v 11 When he put on his glorious robe, 
\q2 and clothed himself in perfect splendor, 
\q2 ascending to the holy altar, 
\q2 he made the court of the sanctuary glorious. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 When he received the portions out of the priests’ hands, 
\q2 as he stood by the hearth of the altar, 
\q2 with his kindred like a garland around him, 
\q2 he was like a young cedar in Lebanon 
\q2 surrounded by the trunks of palm trees. 
\q1
\v 13 All the sons of Aaron in their glory, 
\q2 held the Lord’s offering in their hands before all the congregation of Israel. 
\q1
\v 14 Finishing the service at the altars, 
\q2 that he might arrange the offering of the Most High, the Almighty, 
\q2
\v 15 he stretched out his hand to the cup of libation, 
\q2 and poured out the cup of the grape. 
\q1 He poured it out at the foot of the altar, 
\q2 a sweet smelling fragrance to the Most High, the King of all. 
\q1
\v 16 Then the sons of Aaron shouted. 
\q2 They sounded the trumpets of beaten work. 
\q1 They made a great fanfare to be heard, 
\q2 for a reminder before the Most High. 
\q1
\v 17 Then all the people together hurried, 
\q2 and fell down to the ground on their faces 
\q2 to worship their Lord, the Almighty, God Most High.

\v 18 The singers also praised him with their voices.

\q1
\v 1 I will give thanks to you, O Lord, O King, 
\q2 and will praise you, O God my Savior. 
\q1 I give thanks to your name, 
\q2
\v 2 for you have been my protector and helper, 
\q2 and delivered my body out of destruction, 
\q2 and out of the snare of a slanderous tongue, 
\q2 from lips that fabricate lies. 
\q1 You were my helper before those who stood by, 
\q2
\v 3 and delivered me, according to the abundance of your mercy and of your name, 
\q2 from the gnashings of teeth ready to devour, 
\q2 out of the hand of those seeking my life, 
\q2 out of the many afflictions I endured, 
\q2
\v 4 from the choking of a fire on every side, 
\q2 and out of the midst of fire that I hadn’t kindled, 
\q2
\v 5 out of the depth of the belly of Hades, 
\q2 from an unclean tongue, 
\q2 and from lying words— 
\q2
\v 6 the slander of an unrighteous tongue to the king. 
\q1 My soul drew near to death. 
\q2 My life was near to Hades. 
\q1
\v 7 They surrounded me on every side. 
\q2 There was no one to help me. 
\q1 I was looking for human help, 
\q2 and there was none. 
\q1
\v 8 Then I remembered your mercy, O Lord, 
\q2 and your working which has been from everlasting, 
\q2 how you deliver those who wait for you, 
\q2 and save them out of the hand of their enemies. 
\q1
\v 9 I lifted up my prayer from the earth, 
\q2 and prayed for deliverance from death. 
\q1
\v 10 I called upon the Lord, the Father of my Lord, 
\q2 that he would not forsake me in the days of affliction, 
\q2 in the time when there was no help against the proud. 
\q1
\v 11 I will praise your name continually. 
\q2 I will sing praise with thanksgiving. 
\q2 My prayer was heard. 
\q1
\v 12 You saved me from destruction 
\q2 and delivered me from the evil time. 
\q1 Therefore I will give thanks and praise to you, 
\q2 and bless the name of the Lord.

\q1
\v 13 When I was yet young, 
\q2 before I went abroad, 
\q2 I sought wisdom openly in my prayer. 
\q1
\v 14 Before the temple I asked for her. 
\q2 I will seek her out even to the end. 
\q1
\v 15 From the first flower to the ripening grape my heart delighted in her. 
\q2 My foot walked in uprightness. 
\q2 From my youth I followed her steps. 
\q1
\v 16 I inclined my ear a little, and received her, 
\q2 and found for myself much instruction. 
\q1
\v 17 I profited in her. 
\q2 I will give glory to him who gives me wisdom. 
\q1
\v 18 For I determined to practice her. 
\q2 I was zealous for that which is good. 
\q2 I will never be put to shame. 
\q1
\v 19 My soul has wrestled with her. 
\q2 In my conduct I was exact. 
\q1 I spread out my hands to the heaven above, 
\q2 and bewailed my ignorances of her. 
\q1
\v 20 I directed my soul to her. 
\q2 In purity I found her. 
\q1 I got myself a heart joined with her from the beginning. 
\q2 Therefore I won’t be forsaken. 
\q1
\v 21 My belly also was troubled to seek her. 
\q2 Therefore I have gained a good possession.

\q2 and live in the house of instruction. 
\q1
\v 24 Why therefore are you all lacking in these things, 
\q2 and your souls are very thirsty? 
\q1
\v 25 I opened my mouth and spoke, 
\q2 “Get her for yourselves without money.” 
\q1
\v 26 Put your neck under the yoke, 
\q2 and let your soul receive instruction. 
\q2 She is near to find.

\v 28 Get instruction with a great sum of silver, 
\q2 and gain much gold by her. 
\q1
\v 29 May your soul rejoice in his mercy, 
\q2 and may you all not be put to shame in praising him.

\v 30 Work your work before the time comes, 
\q2 and in his time he will give you your reward.
