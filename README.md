A collection of local-first, collaborative tools for daily life.

I've made these apps using my framework [Verdant](https://verdant.dev) to meet some of my own needs and curiosities. They're all free to use forever on your device, just open one and get started.

To unlock sync, collaboration, and special features, you can sign up for a [plan](https://biscuits.club/join). Paid users support development and ongoing maintenance of the servers which power the features a membership unlocks.

## Source Code, License, Usage

Biscuits is, obviously, open source!

It's licensed under AGPL, which practically means that if you modify or otherwise use it in a commercial product, that must also be open source. If this doesn't work for your intended use case, get in touch about a proprietary license. I'll say outright, I haven't navigated those waters before, but I'm open to it if you really want to host a derivative of Biscuits or one of its apps in a commercial capacity. I just want to protect my work by default.

This license doesn't restrict users of Biscuits.club, the service I host, from using the software for commercial purposes. For example, if you used Gnocchi to plan a shopping list for a cafe, that's perfectly fine.
